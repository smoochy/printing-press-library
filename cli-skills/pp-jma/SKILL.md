# JMA source workflow

## Prerequisites: Install the CLI

This skill drives the `jma-pp-cli` binary. **You must verify the CLI is installed before invoking any command from this skill.** If it is missing, install it first:

1. Install via the Printing Press installer. It defaults binaries to `$HOME/.local/bin` on macOS/Linux and `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\PrintingPress\bin` on Windows:
   ```bash
   npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install jma --cli-only
   ```
2. Verify: `jma-pp-cli --version`
3. Ensure the reported install directory is on `$PATH` for the agent/runtime that will invoke this skill.

If the `npx` install fails (no Node, offline, etc.), fall back to a direct Go install (requires Go 1.26.6 or newer). This installs into `$GOPATH/bin` (default `$HOME/go/bin`), so add that directory to `$PATH` instead:

```bash
go install github.com/mvanhorn/printing-press-library/library/travel/jma/cmd/jma-pp-cli@latest
```

If `--version` reports "command not found" after install, the runtime cannot see the binary directory on `$PATH`. Do not proceed with skill commands until verification succeeds.


1. Resolve the destination with `jma-pp-cli areas search --query Kyoto --kind municipality`, then `areas resolve --area 2610000`. Use the returned source ID; exact name ambiguity is an error. Stations are forecast temperature references; use `stations search` for a station request.
2. Read `forecast get --area 130010 --period all --days 3`. Preserve district/station IDs, issued and valid times, units, source confidence and missing null values. Short extrema time markers are not instantaneous temperatures.
3. Read `warnings get --area 1310100`. Summaries cover all resolved municipalities before pagination. Report source Japanese wording and lifecycle; inspect `--detail` for source hazard properties. `none_reported` concerns retrieved municipality weather products only. `incomplete`, transport failure, missing records and unknown codes do not establish no warnings.
4. Discover current cyclone IDs with `typhoons list`, then fetch selected detail with `typhoons get --id TC2632`. Obtain a current ID before running the example. Distinguish JMA analysis, estimate and forecast. A 70% center probability circle is forecast uncertainty; it does not represent cyclone size or a guaranteed path. Historical analysis tracks in `--detail` have no individual timestamps.
5. Check `meta.coverage`, `meta.sources`, issue ages and `page.next_offset`. Use `--refresh` for a fresh network request. `inventory refresh` is explicit; source inventory reads are offline and do not silently refresh. `--offline` fails on stale/missing weather cache. Finish when the requested source evidence is retrieved and its geographic/temporal limits are reported, or a retrieval failure is clearly reported.

## Agent output

```sh
jma-pp-cli forecast get --area 130010 --agent --select results.series
jma-pp-cli warnings get --area 1340100 --detail --select state,municipalities.events
jma-pp-cli typhoons list --select results.id,results.issued_at
jma-pp-cli stations search --query Tokyo --limit 5
```

JSON is compact by default. Dotted field projection traverses arrays and always retains provenance/pagination. Exit 2 indicates input/projection/resolution error; 4 transport/cache/offline error; 5 incomplete/incompatible source data. Diagnostics go to stderr. Source absence stays null. Use `--cache-dir` to isolate this CLI's cache and an absolute `--home` to isolate framework state. No API key or paid account is required.

## Boundaries

Read [README.md](README.md#forecast-interpretation) when explaining source validity, station coverage or warning completeness. Municipality weather warnings exclude joint river flood bulletins and coastal-zone supplements; warning valid-until is unknown. Issue age is not warning expiry. Present JMA wording accurately without personal safety clearance or evacuation advice. Choose another source for earthquake, tsunami, volcano, radar, observation/history, long-range forecasts, geocoding, transport operation status or weather outside JMA's scope. No purchases, bookings or provider writes.

## Unique Capabilities

These capabilities aren't available in any other tool for this API.

### Source correctness
- **`areas resolve`** — Resolve source IDs and reject ambiguous destination names.

  _Resolve source IDs and reject ambiguous destination names._

  ```bash
  jma-pp-cli areas resolve --area 1310100 --agent
  ```
- **`warnings get`** — Separate applicable no-warning, not-applicable, lifted and incomplete source records.

  _Separate applicable no-warning, not-applicable, lifted and incomplete source records._

  ```bash
  jma-pp-cli warnings get --area 1340100 --agent
  ```
- **`typhoons get`** — Join matching JMA issued/valid-time geometry and intensity documents.

  _Join matching JMA issued/valid-time geometry and intensity documents._

  ```bash
  jma-pp-cli typhoons get --id TC2633 --agent
  ```
- **`typhoons list`** — Discover current source cyclone IDs without detail requests.

  _Discover current source cyclone IDs without detail requests._

  ```bash
  jma-pp-cli typhoons list --agent
  ```
- **`inventory refresh`** — Validate first-party source catalogs before atomic local replacement.

  _Validate first-party source catalogs before atomic local replacement._

  ```bash
  jma-pp-cli inventory refresh --agent
  ```

## Recipes

### Tokyo warnings

```bash
jma-pp-cli warnings get --area 1310100 --agent --select results
```

Municipality-specific source status

### Typhoon discovery

```bash
jma-pp-cli typhoons list --agent
```

Lazy active cyclone inventory
