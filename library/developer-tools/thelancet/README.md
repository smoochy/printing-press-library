# The Lancet CLI

**Search Lancet articles offline and analyze author impact, institutional networks, and editorial trends — powered by the free OpenAlex scholarly graph.**

The Lancet CLI gives researchers and institutions offline access to The Lancet family of journals via OpenAlex. Beyond search and fetch, it ranks researchers by citation impact within a specialty (rank-authors), maps institutional co-authorship networks (mesh), tracks which institutions are publishing more over time (affiliation-growth), and detects how a journal's editorial focus shifts (drift) — insights impossible from single API queries or paywalled tools.

Rolling refreshes keep the newest papers when the page limit is reached. Refreshed papers update their stored metadata, and cited paper titles are cleaned before terminal display.

## Install

The recommended path installs both the `thelancet-pp-cli` binary and the `pp-thelancet` agent skill (Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, Gemini CLI, GitHub Copilot, and other agents supported by the upstream [`skills`](https://github.com/vercel-labs/skills) CLI) in one shot:

```bash
npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install thelancet
```

For CLI only (no skill):

```bash
npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install thelancet --cli-only
```

For skill only — installs the skill into the same agents as the default command above, but skips the CLI binary (use this to update or reinstall just the skill):

```bash
npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install thelancet --skill-only
```

To constrain the skill install to one or more specific agents (repeatable — agent names match the [`skills`](https://github.com/vercel-labs/skills) CLI):

```bash
npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install thelancet --agent claude-code
npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install thelancet --agent claude-code --agent codex
```

### Without Node (Go fallback)

If `npx` isn't available (no Node, offline), install the CLI directly via Go (requires Go 1.26.4 or newer):

```bash
go install github.com/mvanhorn/printing-press-library/library/other/thelancet/cmd/thelancet-pp-cli@latest
```

This installs the CLI only — no skill.

### Pre-built binary

Download a pre-built binary for your platform from the [latest release](https://github.com/mvanhorn/printing-press-library/releases/tag/thelancet-current). On macOS, clear the Gatekeeper quarantine: `xattr -d com.apple.quarantine <binary>`. On Unix, mark it executable: `chmod +x <binary>`.

<!-- pp-hermes-install-anchor -->
## Install for Hermes

Install the CLI binary first. The installer writes binaries to a per-user managed bin directory by default: `$HOME/.local/bin` on macOS/Linux and `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\PrintingPress\bin` on Windows.

```bash
npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install thelancet --cli-only
```

Then install the focused Hermes skill.

From the Hermes CLI:

```bash
hermes skills install mvanhorn/printing-press-library/cli-skills/pp-thelancet --force
```

Inside a Hermes chat session:

```bash
/skills install mvanhorn/printing-press-library/cli-skills/pp-thelancet --force
```

Restart the Hermes session or gateway if the newly installed skill is not visible immediately.

## Install for OpenClaw
Install both the CLI binary and the focused OpenClaw skill. The installer defaults binaries to a per-user bin directory (`$HOME/.local/bin` on macOS/Linux, `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\PrintingPress\bin` on Windows):

```bash
npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install thelancet --agent openclaw
```

Restart the OpenClaw session or gateway if the newly installed skill is not visible immediately.

## Use with Claude Desktop

This CLI ships an [MCPB](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/mcpb) bundle — Claude Desktop's standard format for one-click MCP extension installs (no JSON config required).

To install:

1. Download the `.mcpb` for your platform from the [latest release](https://github.com/mvanhorn/printing-press-library/releases/tag/thelancet-current).
2. Double-click the `.mcpb` file. Claude Desktop opens and walks you through the install.

Requires Claude Desktop 1.0.0 or later. Pre-built bundles ship for macOS Apple Silicon (`darwin-arm64`) and Windows (`amd64`, `arm64`); for other platforms, use the manual config below.

<details>
<summary>Manual JSON config (advanced)</summary>

If you can't use the MCPB bundle (older Claude Desktop, unsupported platform), install the MCP binary and configure it manually.


```bash
go install github.com/mvanhorn/printing-press-library/library/other/thelancet/cmd/thelancet-pp-mcp@latest
```

Add to your Claude Desktop config (`~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "thelancet": {
      "command": "thelancet-pp-mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

## Quick Start

```bash
# Verify the CLI is working and OpenAlex is reachable (no auth required)
thelancet-pp-cli doctor --dry-run

# Find recent Lancet articles on a research topic (scoped to Lancet journals by default)
thelancet-pp-cli works search --search 'CRISPR gene therapy' --per-page 5

# Build the local database from OpenAlex so the analytics commands below can run offline
thelancet-pp-cli refresh --journal lancet

# Rank the most-cited authors in a specific Lancet journal
thelancet-pp-cli rank-authors --journal lancet-oncology --json

# See how the journal's editorial focus has shifted between two periods
thelancet-pp-cli drift --journal lancet-oncology --window1 2018:2020 --window2 2023:2024

```

## Unique Features

These capabilities aren't available in any other tool for this API.

### Local data compounds
- **`rank-authors`** — Rank researchers at your institution by citation impact within a specific Lancet journal or topic.

  _Grant managers and department heads use this to identify who is leading at your institution in a specific field; agents can use it to find high-impact collaborators._

  ```bash
  thelancet-pp-cli rank-authors --institution 'Harvard' --journal lancet-oncology --json
  ```
- **`mesh`** — Find researchers at your institution who co-author Lancet papers and quantify how their work connects.

  _Librarians and research directors use this to uncover collaboration opportunities and map how an institution's researchers connect through Lancet._

  ```bash
  thelancet-pp-cli mesh --org 'Stanford University' --json
  ```
- **`affiliation-growth`** — Track institutions gaining publication velocity in Lancet journals; identify rising research centers.

  _Strategy teams track this to understand competitive research landscapes and identify emerging partner institutions._

  ```bash
  thelancet-pp-cli affiliation-growth --journal lancet-neurology --years 5 --json
  ```
- **`visibility-gap`** — Find authors whose citation impact is out of step with the prestige of the Lancet journals they publish in.

  _Grant managers and research directors use this to identify under-recognized talent for promotion or collaboration._

  ```bash
  thelancet-pp-cli visibility-gap --institution 'Oxford' --json
  ```

### Offline analysis
- **`drift`** — Compare how a journal's topic distribution shifts between two time windows; spot emerging and fading specialties.

  _Research strategists use this to align their work with journal editorial priorities and detect when journal scope shifts._

  ```bash
  thelancet-pp-cli drift --journal lancet-oncology --window1 2018:2020 --window2 2023:2024 --json
  ```
- **`curate`** — Auto-generate ranked reading lists for a topic, sorted by citations, date, per-year (average citations per year since publication; age = years since pub_date, or July 1 of the year if unknown, at least 0.25) or velocity (recency-weighted mean of citations in the last up to 3 complete calendar years, weights 0.5/0.3/0.2; needs a refreshed store); per-year and velocity use the local store only, exportable as Markdown or BibTeX. Works whose yearly counts were never fetched (counts_synced_at is NULL) have no velocity and rank last; --sort velocity prints one stderr line with how many matched works lack counts and fails with a refresh hint when none have them.

  _Librarians and researchers use this to quickly assemble authoritative reading lists without manual screening._

  ```bash
  thelancet-pp-cli curate --topic 'gene therapy' --sort citations --output bibtex
  ```

## Recipes


### Build a topic reading list for a literature review

```bash
thelancet-pp-cli curate --topic 'machine learning diagnosis' --sort citations --output bibtex > review.bib
```

Generate a citation-ranked, BibTeX-exportable reading list on a topic across Lancet journals in one command.

### Narrow a deeply nested works response for an agent

```bash
thelancet-pp-cli works search --search 'immunotherapy' --per-page 10 --agent --select results.title,results.cited_by_count,results.authorships.author.display_name
```

OpenAlex works are large and deeply nested; pair --agent with dotted --select paths to return only the fields you need and save context.

### Spot editorial drift in a specialty journal

```bash
thelancet-pp-cli drift --journal lancet-oncology --window1 2018:2020 --window2 2023:2024 --top-n 15
```

Compare topic distributions across two multi-year windows to see which specialties the journal now publishes more or less of.

## Local JSON API

The `serve` command exposes the analytics engine as a local read-only JSON API — useful for the Lancet web portal or any local tool that prefers HTTP over shelling out to the CLI:

```bash
# Default: loopback only
thelancet-pp-cli serve

# Custom port (keep it on 127.0.0.1)
thelancet-pp-cli serve --listen 127.0.0.1:9090
```

Two endpoints, mirroring the CLI commands' parameters, defaults, and JSON shapes:

| Endpoint | Mirrors | Query params |
|----------|---------|--------------|
| `GET /affiliations` | `affiliation-growth` | `journal` (slug, default all), `years` (default 5), `threshold` (default 2), `limit` (default 25) |
| `GET /authors` | `rank-authors` | `journal`, `institution` (substring), `limit` (default 25) |

```bash
curl 'http://127.0.0.1:8080/affiliations?journal=lancet-neurology&years=5'
curl 'http://127.0.0.1:8080/authors?institution=Oxford&limit=10'
```

Responses are the same JSON arrays the commands emit with `--json`. Invalid parameters return `400` with `{"error": "..."}`; engine failures return `500` with a generic structured error (no internal detail). Use `--db` to point at a non-default database path; stop with Ctrl+C (graceful shutdown).

**Security:** binds to loopback (`127.0.0.1:8080`) by default, serves only read queries against the local mirror, and has no authentication — do not expose it on a public interface.

## Usage

Run `thelancet-pp-cli --help` for the full command reference and flag list.

## Output Formats

```bash
# Human-readable table (default in terminal, JSON when piped)
thelancet-pp-cli authors get mock-value

# JSON for scripting and agents
thelancet-pp-cli authors get mock-value --json

# Filter to specific fields
thelancet-pp-cli authors get mock-value --json --select id,name,status

# Dry run — show the request without sending
thelancet-pp-cli authors get mock-value --dry-run

# Agent mode — JSON + compact + no prompts in one flag
thelancet-pp-cli authors get mock-value --agent
```

## Agent Usage

This CLI is designed for AI agent consumption:

- **Non-interactive** - never prompts, every input is a flag
- **Pipeable** - `--json` output to stdout, errors to stderr
- **Filterable** - `--select id,name` returns only fields you need
- **Previewable** - `--dry-run` shows the request without sending
- **Read-only by default** - this CLI does not create, update, delete, publish, send, or mutate remote resources
- **Offline-friendly** - sync/search commands can use the local SQLite store when available
- **Agent-safe by default** - no colors or formatting unless `--human-friendly` is set

Exit codes: `0` success, `2` usage error, `3` not found, `5` API error, `7` rate limited, `10` config error.

## Health Check

```bash
thelancet-pp-cli doctor
```

Verifies configuration and connectivity to the API.

## Configuration

Config file: `~/.config/lancet-via-openalex-pp-cli/config.toml`

Static request headers can be configured under `headers`; per-command header overrides take precedence.

## Troubleshooting
**Not found errors (exit code 3)**
- Check the resource ID is correct
- Run the `list` command to see available items

### API-specific
- **analytics command says 'no local mirror'** — Run refresh first: thelancet-pp-cli refresh --journal lancet (analytics read the local OpenAlex-derived store)
- **rank-authors or mesh returns empty for an institution** — Institution names match OpenAlex display names; try a distinctive substring like 'Oxford' rather than a full legal name or acronym
- **OpenAlex returns 429 (rate limited)** — OpenAlex meters usage per API key (no key = 1,000 list calls/day). Get a free key at openalex.org/settings/api and export OPENALEX_API_KEY (sent as a Bearer header, masked in dry-run output and errors); also lower --rate-limit if needed
