# kuma-pp-cli

`kuma-pp-cli` is a small operator CLI for Uptime Kuma v2. It uses Kuma's Socket.IO protocol rather than pretending the dashboard is a REST API.

This catalog package is intentionally separate from the native `kumactl` HTTP MCP service. The package currently contains the generated Go CLI and its Socket.IO client; it does not install or embed a Python `kumactl` dependency, and it does not provide an MCP transport.

## Configuration

Set `UPTIME_KUMA_URL`, `UPTIME_KUMA_USERNAME`, and `UPTIME_KUMA_PASSWORD` (or pass `--url`, `--username`, and `--password`). Never commit credentials.

## Commands

```text
kuma-pp-cli health
kuma-pp-cli monitors [--query text] [--json]
kuma-pp-cli heartbeats [--hours 3] [--monitor-id N] [--json]
kuma-pp-cli incident-context --monitor id-or-name [--lookback-minutes 60] [--json]
kuma-pp-cli set-retries --monitor id-or-name --maxretries N       # dry-run
kuma-pp-cli set-retries --monitor id-or-name --maxretries N --yes
kuma-pp-cli agent-context [--pretty]
kuma-pp-cli version
kuma-pp-cli --version
```

`UPTIME_KUMA_URL` must be the server origin (for example `https://kuma.example.com`). A dashboard page URL is reduced to its origin automatically.

`agent-context` emits machine-readable JSON describing every command, flag, and auth variable, so agents can introspect the CLI without parsing `--help`.

## Native HTTP MCP service

For MCP clients, deploy the separately published native `kumactl` service rather than this generated Go CLI:

```bash
kumactl-mcp --transport streamable-http --host 127.0.0.1 --port 40108 --path /mcp
```

The native service uses the same `UPTIME_KUMA_URL`, `UPTIME_KUMA_USERNAME`, and `UPTIME_KUMA_PASSWORD` environment variables. This package preserves those variables for `kuma-pp-cli`; it does not rename the CLI to `kumactl` or add a dependency on the native service.

All mutations are operator-gated and dry-run by default. The client sends complete monitor objects for `editMonitor`, because Kuma v2 treats edits as full replacement.

## Development

```bash
go test ./...
go vet ./...
go build ./...
```
