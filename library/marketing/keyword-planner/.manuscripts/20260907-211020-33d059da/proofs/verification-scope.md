# Verification scope

The generated source passed 1,162 module tests across 16 packages, build, vet and reachable-dependency vulnerability checks. The publish-time full live matrix passed 91 mandatory rows, failed zero, and retained 62 skipped/unverified rows. Two free-text search rows are runner fixture limitations; independent network-denied matching and non-matching searches passed.

Both live Ideas and Historical collection succeeded. Independent local SQL checks reconciled stored raw receipts and normalized monthly rows; the read-only DuckDB recipe and all six evidence views passed. MCP stdio exposed 28 curated tools and passed eight network-denied checks. No performance or reliability comparison against competing implementations was run.

The optional generated HTTP transport is outside the verified stdio surface and now has a five-second ReadHeaderTimeout regression test; hosted HTTP deployment remains unverified. Static generated-code observations are recorded as qualified limitations; the project does not claim universal SQL/path safety.

The focused `TestDiffDuplicateMetricsUseDeterministicContentPairing` exits 1 against the initial public `f7de23e` implementation because independently generated metric IDs produce false changes, then passes on the patched source with the content-first deterministic matcher. The complete internal/portfolio package also passes on the patched source.

Published proofs omit account/customer identifiers, credential values, private paths and full collected data. Sanitization changes identifying strings only, preserving pass/fail counts and source fingerprints.
