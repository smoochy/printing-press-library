# Google Keyword Planner CLI

**Turn Google Keyword Planner reads into an immutable local evidence portfolio for offline research and safe warehouse handoff.**

The CLI collects keyword ideas and historical monthly metrics through Google's read-only v25 REST methods, preserving every raw response, request scope, coverage state, and supplied bid field in SQLite. Use the portfolio commands to trace a number to its receipt, compare preserved snapshots, keep close-variant lineage visible, and calculate policy-safe descriptive statistics offline. Planner search-volume and advertiser-bid fields are vendor estimates for subject research, not measured YouTube demand, YouTube RPM, or a revenue forecast.

## Install

Install the CLI from the public catalogue:

```bash
npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install keyword-planner --cli-only
keyword-planner-pp-cli --version
keyword-planner-pp-cli doctor --json
```

The catalogue's binary is named `keyword-planner-pp-cli`. Ensure the install directory is on PATH. To build a checkout from source, use Go 1.26.6 or newer:

```bash
go build -o build/keyword-planner-pp-cli ./cmd/keyword-planner-pp-cli
./build/keyword-planner-pp-cli --version
```

## Quick Start

Configure your Google Ads credentials as described below before collecting. The database starts empty. After your first collection, use `portfolio list` to obtain snapshot IDs; replace the example IDs in analytical recipes. Dated examples illustrate historical requests—choose a closed month available in your snapshot.

```bash
# Verify the local configuration and portfolio schema without network activity or credentials.
keyword-planner-pp-cli doctor --json

# Collect subject-level ideas with explicit language and geography while preserving every result page.
keyword-planner-pp-cli ideas --seed "beef steak" --seed "ribeye steak" --seed "beef brisket" --seed "pork chops" --seed "meat cutting" --seed "butchery" --language languageConstants/1000 --geo geoTargetConstants/2840 --agent

# Retrieve the chosen wording's monthly history and keep submitted, returned, and variant relationships.
keyword-planner-pp-cli historical --keyword "beef steak" --keyword "beef brisket" --language languageConstants/1000 --geo geoTargetConstants/2840 --agent

# Check returned and missing coverage before using a saved collection.
keyword-planner-pp-cli portfolio coverage latest --agent

# Export a narrow, traceable relation for the read-only DuckDB consumer.
keyword-planner-pp-cli portfolio export --snapshot latest --agent --select keyword,month,monthly_searches

```

## Unique Features

These local evidence views extend the direct API with receipt, coverage, lineage, comparison, integrity, and descriptive-statistics views.

### Evidence that compounds
- **`portfolio trace`** — Trace one stored monthly value back to the exact request and raw receipt that produced it.

  _Reach for this when a number needs a receipt-backed explanation that a direct Planner call cannot provide._

  ```bash
  keyword-planner-pp-cli portfolio trace 2c2f465c-6253-430a-a533-aa30fabbfbff --keyword "beef steak" --month 2026-07 --agent
  ```
- **`portfolio coverage`** — See requested, returned, missing, unavailable, raw-only, and incomplete coverage for a saved collection.

  _Use this before consuming a collection when the API response alone cannot explain what was absent or incomplete._

  ```bash
  keyword-planner-pp-cli portfolio coverage latest --agent
  ```
- **`portfolio diff`** — Compare two preserved collections to see changed terms, monthly values, flags, and coverage.

  _Use this when the question is what changed between saved collections rather than what one live call returns._

  ```bash
  keyword-planner-pp-cli portfolio diff 2c2f465c-6253-430a-a533-aa30fabbfbff c6ea4780-190b-42f4-8f4d-a8b7207a2395 --agent
  ```

### Safe warehouse handoff
- **`portfolio variants`** — Follow submitted keywords through returned terms and close variants without double-counting demand.

  _Pick this when a Planner result must be interpreted with its returned-term and close-variant relationships intact._

  ```bash
  keyword-planner-pp-cli portfolio variants latest --limit 10 --agent --json
  ```
- **`portfolio integrity`** — Verify that raw receipts, hashes, normalized rows, and coverage still reconcile.

  _Run this before a warehouse handoff when evidence integrity matters more than a fresh remote request._

  ```bash
  keyword-planner-pp-cli portfolio integrity latest --agent
  ```
- **`portfolio safe-stats`** — Compute descriptive monthly aggregates while excluding unavailable, ambiguous, anomalous, and incomplete rows.

  _Choose this for mechanical local summaries that must preserve warnings and avoid turning Planner signals into forecasts._

  ```bash
  keyword-planner-pp-cli portfolio safe-stats --snapshot latest --agent
  ```

## Authentication

Authentication uses the OAuth refresh-token flow with GOOGLE_ADS_CLIENT_ID, GOOGLE_ADS_CLIENT_SECRET, GOOGLE_ADS_REFRESH_TOKEN, and GOOGLE_ADS_DEVELOPER_TOKEN loaded from ~/.env. GOOGLE_ADS_LOGIN_CUSTOMER_ID is the optional manager login header, while GOOGLE_ADS_CUSTOMER_ID is the separately resolved operating account; the approved OAuth grant carries the required AdWords scope, the CLI refreshes a short-lived access token in memory, and sends Authorization: Bearer plus developer-token and, when applicable, login-customer-id. Token responses are never stored in the portfolio, and an invalid grant, permission or developer-token error, or customer routing failure is an account-setup problem rather than a reason to loop retries.

## Configuration

Planner credentials default to `~/.env`, a private regular file. Environment bindings override values in that file; explicit command flags override the corresponding path or customer binding.

| Binding | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `GOOGLE_ADS_CLIENT_ID` | OAuth application's client ID |
| `GOOGLE_ADS_CLIENT_SECRET` | OAuth application's protected client secret |
| `GOOGLE_ADS_REFRESH_TOKEN` | Approved grant used to obtain an in-memory access token |
| `GOOGLE_ADS_DEVELOPER_TOKEN` | Google Ads developer access token |
| `GOOGLE_ADS_CUSTOMER_ID` | Operating customer; `--customer-id` overrides it |
| `GOOGLE_ADS_LOGIN_CUSTOMER_ID` | Optional manager login context, resolved separately |
| `KEYWORD_PLANNER_ENV_FILE` | Override credential-file location; `--env-file` takes precedence |
| `KEYWORD_PLANNER_DB` | Override portfolio location; `--db` takes precedence |
| `KEYWORD_PLANNER_CALL_LEDGER` | Optional private local file recording Ads request attempts |
| `KEYWORD_PLANNER_CONFIG` | Generated framework's separate `config.json` location; not the Planner credential file |
| `KEYWORD_PLANNER_BASE_URL` | Retained generated test-client setting; it does not redirect the curated Planner transport |

The old `KEYWORD_PLANNER_ACCESS_TOKEN` environment reader is retired. Use the approved refresh-token bindings. Shared Printing Press learning and profile state is separate from the Planner portfolio; its runtime locations are available through `agent-context` and command help.

## Data policy

Use six to eight seeds at the subject's level. The API accepts one to twenty, so other valid counts produce a warning. Language and geography must be explicit official resource names. The only network is `GOOGLE_SEARCH`. Empty geography needs explicit all-geographies acknowledgement.

The default range is the latest twelve closed UTC months; explicit ranges override it. Missing months and missing CPC are unavailable, never inferred zero. A short returned window remains usable. Current/future request months are rejected; unexpected open months remain raw-only. Google's trailing twelve-month average and snapshot-level bid micros retain their original meaning.

Every response is saved before decoding. Every repeat creates a new snapshot. Errors and interrupted collections remain visible and incomplete. Local output limits do not reduce collection scope. Ambiguous zero/UNSPECIFIED metrics remain inspectable with `PLANNER-BLIND` and are excluded from safe aggregates. See [DATA-CONTRACT.md](DATA-CONTRACT.md) for null, month, variant, currency, and coverage rules.

## Troubleshooting

- `invalid_grant`: the grant needs inspection or renewed authorization; repeating the same invalid grant will not repair it.
- Permission, developer-token, or customer errors: inspect the separately configured target and manager context, and the provider's specific error code. Do not create or link accounts automatically.
- Quota errors: use bounded retries only for transient throttling. Local pacing coordinates processes on this host; it does not coordinate other hosts or represent account-wide remaining quota.
- Empty data: check coverage and exact request scope. A valid empty response has no inferred suppression cause.
- No August data in an early September response: inspect coverage; a closed month need not already be available from Google.

### API-specific
- **OAuth returns invalid_grant** — Inspect the approved OAuth grant and protected bindings in `~/.env`; after correcting the grant, run `keyword-planner-pp-cli doctor --live`. Do not retry the same invalid grant.
- **USER_PERMISSION_DENIED or CUSTOMER_NOT_ENABLED** — Verify that GOOGLE_ADS_CUSTOMER_ID names the operating account and GOOGLE_ADS_LOGIN_CUSTOMER_ID is only the manager context, then rerun `keyword-planner-pp-cli doctor --live` after access is corrected.
- **DEVELOPER_TOKEN_NOT_APPROVED or DEVELOPER_TOKEN_PROHIBITED** — Use a developer token approved for the operating account and rerun `keyword-planner-pp-cli doctor --live`; do not switch providers or retry a permanently rejected token.
- **A request uses an invalid language or geo resource name** — Pass a verified `languageConstants/<id>` and `geoTargetConstants/<id>` value; resolve labels before the live call.
- **The Planner request is rate-limited or daily quota is exhausted** — Keep Planner calls at no more than one request per second per operating customer, allow bounded transient backoff, and stop on persistent daily-quota errors.
- **The requested range ends in the current or a future month** — Set the end month to a closed UTC calendar month; the CLI rejects open and future ranges before network activity.

## Commands

| Command | Result |
|---|---|
| `ideas` | Full keyword-idea collection, including every result page |
| `historical` | Chosen-keyword monthly metrics, preserving input/variant linkage |
| `portfolio list` | Snapshot inventory |
| `portfolio show` | Request context, raw receipts, rows, and coverage |
| `portfolio search` | Filtered local evidence |
| `portfolio export` | Offline JSON or CSV rows |
| `doctor` | Offline local readiness; explicit live mode checks Google |

Use `keyword-planner-pp-cli --help` and each command's help for flags. The source also retains local Printing Press learning/profile helpers; their store is separate from the evidence portfolio.

`--home` relocates the default portfolio and `.env` paths, including quoted `~/...` paths; explicit `--db`, `--env-file`, and their environment overrides take precedence. Planner pacing files remain in the shared user cache so separate portfolio homes cannot independently exceed the customer rate limit. Planner calls use a positive `--timeout` (default 60 seconds). `--rate-limit 0.5` slows calls to one every two seconds; the default is one per second, and disabling or exceeding that ceiling is rejected. Seed and keyword files above 8 MiB fail explicitly before collection. CSV exports honor `--select` even when no rows match.

## Agent Usage

Add `--agent` for structured non-interactive output, or `--json` for complete JSON. Use `--select` to retain specific fields and `--csv` for tabular export. Diagnostics go to stderr; list-shaped empty JSON is `[]`. Use `--dry-run` on a complete collection request to inspect its resolved nonsecret body without a Google call.

Evidence commands retain metric values, eligibility flags and provenance in agent and compact output. Use their explicit `--limit` and `--select` controls to narrow the rendered result. Normal terminal collection and inventory output uses readable tables; piped output remains JSON.

```bash
keyword-planner-pp-cli agent-context --pretty
keyword-planner-pp-cli portfolio export --snapshot latest --json --select keyword,month,monthly_searches
```

The generated MCP command mirror uses the same curated CLI paths and evidence policy. Raw endpoint mirrors are disabled. The local validation does not deploy an MCP server. `tools-manifest.json` retains two hidden upstream endpoint references in the Printing Press schema; `mcp-runtime-tools.json` preserves the 28-tool runtime inventory and full input schemas. The running stdio server is authoritative for tool discovery.

The verified MCP transport is stdio. The optional HTTP server has a five-second header-read timeout and preserves the bearer-authentication, TLS, and bind restrictions. Its configuration is regression-tested; a hosted HTTP deployment remains outside the verified surface.

## Health Check

```bash
keyword-planner-pp-cli doctor --json
keyword-planner-pp-cli doctor --live --json
```

The first command is offline. The second intentionally uses the configured OAuth grant and Google Ads read methods.

Illustrative fields from the publication-time check; your local readiness may differ:

```json
{
  "mode": "offline",
  "database_status": "ok",
  "network": "not contacted",
  "auth": "not checked"
}
```

## Portfolio and DuckDB

The evidence database is `~/.local/share/keyword-planner/snapshots.db`. [sql/keyword_monthly.sql](sql/keyword_monthly.sql) provides the standalone DuckDB read-only attachment and compatibility relation. It preserves original warehouse columns plus provenance and casts dates explicitly. Combined geographies and unresolved mappings do not enter the single-country relation. The warehouse's registry and loaders remain separate.

Run DuckDB from the directory containing `snapshots.db`, then load the SQL recipe with `.read /absolute/path/to/keyword_monthly.sql`. Alternatively, edit only the attachment path in the recipe. Keep `READ_ONLY` enabled.

## Recipes

### Check local readiness

```bash
keyword-planner-pp-cli doctor --json
```

Confirm local setup and portfolio schema without a network call.

### Collect subject-level ideas

```bash
keyword-planner-pp-cli ideas --seed "beef steak" --seed "ribeye steak" --seed "beef brisket" --seed "pork chops" --seed "meat cutting" --seed "butchery" --language languageConstants/1000 --geo geoTargetConstants/2840 --agent
```

Use explicit resource names and preserve all pages for the six-to-eight-seed research pass.

### Retrieve historical wording

```bash
keyword-planner-pp-cli historical --keyword "beef steak" --keyword "beef brisket" --language languageConstants/1000 --geo geoTargetConstants/2840 --agent
```

Keep the submitted terms, returned terms, variant links, and every monthly value.

### Compare preserved collections

```bash
keyword-planner-pp-cli portfolio diff 2c2f465c-6253-430a-a533-aa30fabbfbff c6ea4780-190b-42f4-8f4d-a8b7207a2395 --agent
```

Compare two compatible snapshots selected from `portfolio list` without replacing either or calling Google again.

### Export a DuckDB-ready slice

```bash
keyword-planner-pp-cli portfolio export --snapshot latest --agent --select keyword,month,monthly_searches
```

Emit a narrow, traceable local relation for the read-only warehouse consumer.

### Preview a complete collection request

```bash
keyword-planner-pp-cli historical --keyword "beef steak" --keyword "beef brisket" --language languageConstants/1000 --geo geoTargetConstants/2840 --dry-run --json
```

Inspect resolved targeting and the closed-month range without reading credentials, contacting Google, or writing the portfolio.

### Export one closed month as CSV

```bash
keyword-planner-pp-cli portfolio export --snapshot 2c2f465c-6253-430a-a533-aa30fabbfbff --start 2026-07 --end 2026-07 --format csv
```

Keep the month bound explicit and export local evidence for a spreadsheet.

### Inspect a small available search slice

```bash
keyword-planner-pp-cli portfolio search "beef steak" --snapshot 2c2f465c-6253-430a-a533-aa30fabbfbff --available-only --limit 10 --json
```

Show available saved monthly values with their flags and provenance; availability alone is not the safe-aggregate policy.
