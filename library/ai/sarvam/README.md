# Sarvam AI CLI

**Every Sarvam AI model on your terminal — translate, speak, transcribe, chat, and extract documents in 22 Indian languages, with a local history that compounds**

Sarvam AI's official SDKs and MCP server are great for code, but nothing offers offline capability: no local history of translations, TTS generations, transcriptions, or chat threads. sarvam-pp-cli adds a local SQLite store, voice auditioning, conversation resume, batch job retry/report, pronunciation spot-checks, subtitle export, and a doc-ai extraction schema library — all with --json, --dry-run, and typed exit codes for agents and scripts.

## Install

The recommended path installs both the `sarvam-pp-cli` binary and the `pp-sarvam` agent skill (Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, Gemini CLI, GitHub Copilot, and other agents supported by the upstream [`skills`](https://github.com/vercel-labs/skills) CLI) in one shot:

```bash
npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install sarvam
```

For CLI only (no skill):

```bash
npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install sarvam --cli-only
```

For skill only — installs the skill into the same agents as the default command above, but skips the CLI binary (use this to update or reinstall just the skill):

```bash
npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install sarvam --skill-only
```

To constrain the skill install to one or more specific agents (repeatable — agent names match the [`skills`](https://github.com/vercel-labs/skills) CLI):

```bash
npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install sarvam --agent claude-code
npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install sarvam --agent claude-code --agent codex
```

### Without Node (Go fallback)

If `npx` isn't available (no Node, offline), install the CLI directly via Go (requires Go 1.26.6 or newer):

```bash
go install github.com/mvanhorn/printing-press-library/library/ai/sarvam/cmd/sarvam-pp-cli@latest
```

This installs the CLI only — no skill.

### Pre-built binary

Download a pre-built binary for your platform from the [latest release](https://github.com/mvanhorn/printing-press-library/releases/tag/sarvam-current). On macOS, clear the Gatekeeper quarantine: `xattr -d com.apple.quarantine <binary>`. On Unix, mark it executable: `chmod +x <binary>`.

<!-- pp-hermes-install-anchor -->
## Install for Hermes

Install the CLI binary first. The installer writes binaries to a per-user managed bin directory by default: `$HOME/.local/bin` on macOS/Linux and `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\PrintingPress\bin` on Windows.

```bash
npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install sarvam --cli-only
```

Then install the focused Hermes skill.

From the Hermes CLI:

```bash
hermes skills install mvanhorn/printing-press-library/cli-skills/pp-sarvam --force
```

Inside a Hermes chat session:

```bash
/skills install mvanhorn/printing-press-library/cli-skills/pp-sarvam --force
```

Restart the Hermes session or gateway if the newly installed skill is not visible immediately.

## Install for OpenClaw
Install both the CLI binary and the focused OpenClaw skill. The installer defaults binaries to a per-user bin directory (`$HOME/.local/bin` on macOS/Linux, `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\PrintingPress\bin` on Windows):

```bash
npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install sarvam --agent openclaw
```

Restart the OpenClaw session or gateway if the newly installed skill is not visible immediately.

## Use with Claude Desktop

This CLI ships an [MCPB](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/mcpb) bundle — Claude Desktop's standard format for one-click MCP extension installs (no JSON config required).

To install:

1. Download the `.mcpb` for your platform from the [latest release](https://github.com/mvanhorn/printing-press-library/releases/tag/sarvam-current).
2. Double-click the `.mcpb` file. Claude Desktop opens and walks you through the install.
3. Fill in `SARVAM_API_KEY` when Claude Desktop prompts you. Leave the optional client profile blank unless your setup uses one.

Requires Claude Desktop 1.0.0 or later. Pre-built bundles ship for macOS Apple Silicon (`darwin-arm64`) and Windows (`amd64`, `arm64`); for other platforms, use the manual config below.

<details>
<summary>Manual JSON config (advanced)</summary>

If you can't use the MCPB bundle (older Claude Desktop, unsupported platform), install the MCP binary and configure it manually.


```bash
go install github.com/mvanhorn/printing-press-library/library/ai/sarvam/cmd/sarvam-pp-mcp@latest
```

Add to your Claude Desktop config (`~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "sarvam": {
      "command": "sarvam-pp-mcp",
      "env": {
        "SARVAM_API_KEY": "<your-key>"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

</details>

For HTTP MCP, set `PP_MCP_HTTP_TOKEN` in the server process environment and run `sarvam-pp-mcp --transport http --addr 127.0.0.1:7777`. Configure the HTTP MCP client to connect to `http://127.0.0.1:7777/mcp` and send `Authorization: Bearer <the-token>` with every request. A non-loopback bind also requires `--tls-cert` and `--tls-key`; use an HTTPS URL for that client. Keep the token out of command arguments.

## Authentication

Authentication uses the Sarvam AI API subscription key (sk_ format). Set it with `export SARVAM_API_KEY=sk_...` or `sarvam-pp-cli auth set-token`. The key goes in the `api-subscription-key` header (or `Authorization: Bearer`). Note: an invalid key returns HTTP 403 with `invalid_api_key_error`, not 401 — treat 403 as the auth-failure signal. The separate Voice Agents platform (apps.sarvam.ai) uses a different X-API-Key system and is out of scope for this CLI.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Verify the CLI is installed and configured
sarvam-pp-cli doctor --dry-run

# First translation — the core workflow
sarvam-pp-cli translate --input "Hello, how are you?" --source-language-code en-IN --target-language-code hi-IN

# Generate speech audio
sarvam-pp-cli text-to-speech text-to-speech --text "नमस्ते, स्वागत है" --language-code hi-IN --speaker shubh

# Ask the multilingual chat model
sarvam-pp-cli chat --messages '[{"role":"user","content":"What is Sarvam AI?"}]' --model sarvam-105b

# Search past work offline
sarvam-pp-cli search "नमस्ते" --json

```

## Unique Features

These capabilities aren't available in any other tool for this API.

### Speech workflow
- **`voices preview`** — Generate one sample sentence across every TTS speaker and hear them all side by side

  _Use when choosing a TTS voice for a new language or prompt set without burning manual API calls_

  ```bash
  sarvam-pp-cli voices preview --lang hi-IN --sample "नमस्ते, स्वागत है" --speakers shubh,ritu,priya --output ./voices
  ```
- **`pron-check`** — Verify a term's TTS pronunciation via a speech round-trip (TTS then STT)

  _Use to confirm a pronunciation dictionary edit took effect before shipping IVR prompts_

  ```bash
  sarvam-pp-cli pron-check "SarvamPay" --lang hi-IN
  ```

### Local state that compounds
- **`chat resume`** — Continue a past chat thread from local history with full context

  _Use to continue an assistant session without losing context. New chats save the request messages and reply in your local SQLite database; older response-only records can resume from the last reply but cannot recover earlier prompts. This command sends a new paid chat request._

  ```bash
  sarvam-pp-cli chat resume 20260814_2d09e061 "what was our conclusion?"
  ```

  Completed text-only streamed chats can also be resumed. JSON output includes structured `results.id`, `results.choices`, and `results.usage`, plus the full SSE response in `results.stream`. Only the first text choice is saved for resume. Incomplete streams and streamed tool calls are not saved because their full context cannot be reconstructed safely. Successful text-to-speech requests save their request text in local history. Audio data is not copied into SQLite.
- **`subs`** — Emit .srt/.vtt subtitles from timestamped transcriptions in local history

  _Use to turn a timestamped transcription into subtitles without a throwaway script. Saved subtitles are private to your local account by default._

  ```bash
  sarvam-pp-cli subs --from last --format srt --output subtitles.srt
  ```

### Job orchestration
- **`stt-job retry`** — Re-run only the failed files of a batch STT job with one command

  _Use when a batch job partially fails and you need to reprocess just the failures_

  ```bash
  sarvam-pp-cli stt-job retry 20260707_9f1c2b3a-4d5e-6f70-8a9b-c0d1e2f3a4b5 --failed-only --dir ./audio/
  ```

  Retry checks every pending input file before creating a replacement job. It saves progress in private local state, scoped to the selected client profile when one is active, so a rerun resumes the same job and does not require files already uploaded. After a confirmed start, rerunning reports the existing job. If creation succeeded but saving its ID failed, or if the start request's outcome is unknown, check the replacement job with Sarvam and reconcile the checkpoint shown in the error before rerunning.
- **`stt-job report`** — Per-file digest of a batch STT job with typed exit codes for cron alerting

  _Use in cron to alert when a batch transcription job degrades_

  ```bash
  sarvam-pp-cli stt-job report 20260707_9f1c2b3a-4d5e-6f70-8a9b-c0d1e2f3a4b5 --json
  ```

### Document intelligence
- **`docai schema list`** — Save, list, and diff doc-ai extraction schemas locally

  _Use to version extraction schemas so schema changes never silently break extraction runs_

  ```bash
  sarvam-pp-cli docai schema list
  ```
- **`docai batch`** — Run a saved extraction schema over a folder of documents with job pacing

  _Use for weekly batch document extraction (KYC, invoices) without writing orchestration code_

  ```bash
  sarvam-pp-cli docai batch --schema invoice-v1 --dir ./docs/ --out ./results/
  ```

## Recipes

### Translate a support reply

```bash
sarvam-pp-cli translate --input "Your EMI of Rs. 3000 is pending" --source-language-code en-IN --target-language-code hi-IN --mode formal
```

Translate a single message with formal tone for customer communications

### Audition voices for a new prompt set

```bash
sarvam-pp-cli voices preview --lang hi-IN --sample "नमस्ते, स्वागत है" --speakers shubh,ritu,priya
```

Hear 3 voices on the same sample before committing to a speaker

### Subtitle a promo video

```bash
sarvam-pp-cli subs --from last --format srt --output subtitles.srt
```

Turn the last timestamped transcription into SRT subtitles

### Reprocess failed batch files

```bash
sarvam-pp-cli stt-job retry 20260707_9f1c2b3a-4d5e-6f70-8a9b-c0d1e2f3a4b5 --failed-only --dir ./audio/
```

Re-run only the files that failed in a batch transcription job

### Check a pronunciation dictionary

```bash
sarvam-pp-cli pron-check "SarvamPay" --lang hi-IN --dict p_5cb7faa6
```

Verify a custom pronunciation actually changed how the term sounds

### Extract fields from a folder of documents

```bash
sarvam-pp-cli docai batch --schema invoice-v1 --dir ./docs/ --out ./results/
```

Run a saved extraction schema over every document with pacing

### Continue a past chat session

```bash
sarvam-pp-cli chat resume 20260814_2d09e061 "what was our conclusion?"
```

Pick up an assistant conversation where it left off, with full context

## Usage

Run `sarvam-pp-cli --help` for the full command reference and flag list.

For `export --output`, the parent directory must be writable. The CLI writes an
owner-only temporary file there and replaces the destination after the export
completes, so a failed request leaves the previous file intact.

## Paths & environment variables

This CLI separates local files into four path kinds:

| Kind | Contents |
|------|----------|
| `config` | User-editable settings such as `config.toml` and saved profiles |
| `data` | Durable local data: `credentials.toml`, `data.db`, cookies, browser-session proof files, and other auth sidecars |
| `state` | Runtime state such as persisted queries, jobs, and `teach.log` |
| `cache` | Regenerable HTTP/cache files |

Each kind resolves independently. The ladder is:

1. Per-kind env var: `SARVAM_CONFIG_DIR`, `SARVAM_DATA_DIR`, `SARVAM_STATE_DIR`, or `SARVAM_CACHE_DIR`
2. `--home <dir>` for this invocation
3. `SARVAM_HOME` for a flat relocated root
4. XDG env vars: `XDG_CONFIG_HOME`, `XDG_DATA_HOME`, `XDG_STATE_HOME`, `XDG_CACHE_HOME`
5. Platform defaults matching existing installs

For containers and agent sandboxes, prefer a single relocated root:

```bash
export SARVAM_HOME=/srv/sarvam
sarvam-pp-cli doctor
```

Under `SARVAM_HOME=/srv/sarvam`, the four dirs resolve to `/srv/sarvam/config`, `/srv/sarvam/data`, `/srv/sarvam/state`, and `/srv/sarvam/cache`.

MCP servers do not receive CLI flags from the host. Put relocation in the host `env` block:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "sarvam": {
      "command": "sarvam-pp-mcp",
      "env": {
        "SARVAM_HOME": "/srv/sarvam"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Precedence matters in fleets: an ambient per-kind variable such as `SARVAM_DATA_DIR` overrides an explicit `--home` for that kind. Use `SARVAM_HOME` or the per-kind variables for durable fleet relocation; treat `--home` as the weaker per-invocation lever.

Relocation is one-way. Unsetting `SARVAM_HOME` does not move files back to platform defaults, and `doctor` cannot find credentials left under a former root. Move the files manually before unsetting relocation variables.

Existing installs keep working because the platform-default rung matches the legacy layout. On the first auth write, stored secrets leave `config.toml` and are consolidated into `credentials.toml` under the data directory. Run `sarvam-pp-cli doctor --fail-on warn` to check path and credential-location warnings in automation.

## Commands

### chat

Manage chat

- **`sarvam-pp-cli chat`** - Creates a model response for the given chat conversation. Serves sarvam-105b and sarvam-105b-conversations models. Supports streaming via server-sent events, tool calling, and structured outputs.

### doc-ai

Manage doc ai

- **`sarvam-pp-cli doc-ai digitise`** - Creates and starts a digitisation job from files or pre-uploaded handles. Converts documents to machine-readable text with layout awareness. Runs asynchronously; poll status until terminal.
- **`sarvam-pp-cli doc-ai download-url`** - Returns a presigned URL to download the output of a completed doc-ai job.
- **`sarvam-pp-cli doc-ai extract`** - Creates and starts an extract job from files or pre-uploaded handles. Extract pulls structured fields out of documents according to a schema. Exactly one of file and upload_ids must be provided; exactly one of schema and config_id is required. Runs asynchronously.
- **`sarvam-pp-cli doc-ai results`** - Fetches the results of a completed doc-ai job, including extracted fields and annotations with confidence scores.
- **`sarvam-pp-cli doc-ai status`** - Polls the status of a doc-ai job until a terminal status (completed, partially_completed, failed, rejected).
- **`sarvam-pp-cli doc-ai upload`** - Creates a presigned URL to upload a document for doc-ai processing.

### models

Manage models

- **`sarvam-pp-cli models`** - Lists the model IDs this deployment currently serves. A model is only served where its backend is configured, so the list is environment-specific — fetch it rather than hardcoding IDs.

### speech-to-text

Manage speech to text

- **`sarvam-pp-cli speech-to-text speech-to-text`** - Transcribes speech to text in multiple Indian languages and English. Accepts an audio file via multipart form-data. Supports transcribe, translate, verbatim, translit, and codemix modes.
- **`sarvam-pp-cli speech-to-text stt-job-download`** - Returns presigned download URLs for the output files of a completed batch speech-to-text job.
- **`sarvam-pp-cli speech-to-text stt-job-initiate`** - Creates a new speech-to-text bulk job and returns a job UUID and storage details for processing multiple audio files.
- **`sarvam-pp-cli speech-to-text stt-job-start`** - Starts processing a speech-to-text bulk job after all audio files have been uploaded.
- **`sarvam-pp-cli speech-to-text stt-job-status`** - Returns the status of a batch speech-to-text job including per-file details and download information.
- **`sarvam-pp-cli speech-to-text stt-job-upload`** - Generates presigned upload URLs for audio files that will be processed in a speech-to-text bulk job.

### text-lid

Manage text lid

- **`sarvam-pp-cli text-lid`** - Identifies the language (e.g. hi-IN) and script (e.g. Devanagari) of the input text, supporting 10+ Indian languages and English.

### text-to-speech

Manage text to speech

- **`sarvam-pp-cli text-to-speech create-pronunciation-dictionary`** - Uploads a .json file to create a new pronunciation dictionary. Only supported by bulbul:v3. The returned dictionary_id can be passed as dict_id in text-to-speech requests.
- **`sarvam-pp-cli text-to-speech delete-pronunciation-dictionary`** - Deletes a pronunciation dictionary by ID.
- **`sarvam-pp-cli text-to-speech get-pronunciation-dictionary`** - Fetches a single pronunciation dictionary by ID.
- **`sarvam-pp-cli text-to-speech list-pronunciation-dictionaries`** - Lists all pronunciation dictionaries for the user. Dictionaries define custom word pronunciations used by bulbul:v3 TTS.
- **`sarvam-pp-cli text-to-speech stream`** - Converts the input text into a streamed spoken audio response using the specified output codec (e.g. MP3). Returns binary audio.
- **`sarvam-pp-cli text-to-speech text-to-speech`** - Converts text into spoken audio. The output is a base64-encoded audio string (WAV by default) that must be decoded before use. Supports bulbul:v2 and bulbul:v3 models with 30+ voices.
- **`sarvam-pp-cli text-to-speech update-pronunciation-dictionary`** - Updates an existing pronunciation dictionary with a new JSON file.

### translate

Manage translate

- **`sarvam-pp-cli translate`** - Converts text from one language to another while preserving meaning. Supports 22 Indic languages plus English.

### transliterate

Manage transliterate

- **`sarvam-pp-cli transliterate`** - Transliterates text from one script to another (e.g. Devanagari to Latin) while keeping the same language and pronunciation.


### Self-learning loop

This CLI caches per-question discovery so repeat queries skip the walk and structurally similar queries get answered via entity substitution. The loop also self-captures: every invocation is journaled locally, and failed-flag corrections plus fresh teaches surface as candidates on the next `recall` for confirm/reject judgment. Agents call `recall` before discovery and fire `teach &` after answering. See the `## Automatic learning` section in `SKILL.md` for the full protocol.

- **`sarvam-pp-cli recall <query>`** - Look up cached resources for a query before running discovery
- **`sarvam-pp-cli teach`** - Record a query -> resource mapping (silent on success, safe to background with `&`)
- **`sarvam-pp-cli learnings list`** - Inspect taught rows
- **`sarvam-pp-cli learnings forget <query>`** - Undo a teach
- **`sarvam-pp-cli learnings candidates`** - List auto-captured candidates awaiting confirm/reject
- **`sarvam-pp-cli learnings stats`** - Local loop metrics: recall hit rate, teach-to-reuse, playbook resolution, candidate counts
- **`sarvam-pp-cli teach-pattern`** - Install a query/resource template up front
- **`sarvam-pp-cli teach-lookup`** - Add an entity mapping (e.g. country code, team alias) for pattern substitution

Pass `--no-learn` or set `SARVAM_NO_LEARN=true` to disable the loop for deterministic flows.

The local store's schema version stamp is one-way: once this version of `sarvam-pp-cli` opens the database, older binaries refuse it with a version error — upgrade the binary rather than downgrading.

## Output Formats

```bash
# Human-readable table (default in terminal, JSON when piped)
sarvam-pp-cli models

# JSON for scripting and agents
sarvam-pp-cli models --json
# Filter to specific fields
sarvam-pp-cli models --json --select created,id,object

# Dry run — show the request without sending
sarvam-pp-cli models --dry-run

# Agent mode — JSON + compact + no prompts in one flag
sarvam-pp-cli models --agent
```

## Agent Usage

This CLI is designed for AI agent consumption:

- **Non-interactive** - never prompts, every input is a flag
- **Pipeable** - `--json` output to stdout, errors to stderr
- **Filterable** - `--select <field>[,<field>...]` returns only fields you need
- **Previewable** - `--dry-run` shows the request without sending
- **Explicit retries** - add `--idempotent` to create retries and add `--ignore-missing` to delete retries when a no-op success is acceptable
- **Confirmable** - `--yes` for explicit confirmation of destructive actions
- **Piped input** - write commands can accept structured input when their help lists `--stdin`
- **Offline-friendly** - sync/search commands can use the local SQLite store when available
- **Agent-safe by default** - no colors or formatting unless `--human-friendly` is set

Exit codes: `0` success, `2` usage error, `3` not found, `4` auth error, `5` API error, `7` rate limited, `10` config error.

## Health Check

```bash
sarvam-pp-cli doctor
```

Verifies configuration, credentials, and connectivity to the API.

## Configuration

Run `sarvam-pp-cli doctor` to see the resolved config, data, state, and cache directories. The platform-default config path is `~/.config/sarvam-ai-pp-cli/config.toml`; `--home`, `SARVAM_HOME`, and per-kind env vars can relocate it.

Static request headers can be configured under `headers`; per-command header overrides take precedence.

Environment variables:

| Name | Kind | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `SARVAM_API_KEY` | per_call | Yes | Set to your API credential. |

### agentcookie (optional)

If you use agentcookie to sync secrets across machines, this CLI auto-adopts agentcookie-managed credentials with no extra setup. When the daemon writes to this CLI's config, `sarvam-pp-cli doctor` reports `agentcookie: detected` and `auth-status` labels the source as `agentcookie`. Skip this section if you don't use agentcookie - the CLI works the same as any other.

## Troubleshooting
**Authentication errors (exit code 4)**
- Run `sarvam-pp-cli doctor` to check credentials
- Verify the environment variable is set: `echo $SARVAM_API_KEY`
**Not found errors (exit code 3)**
- Check the resource ID is correct
- Run the `list` command to see available items

### API-specific
- **HTTP 403 invalid_api_key_error** — The key is invalid or expired — not a 401. Re-run `sarvam-pp-cli auth set-token` with a fresh key from the Sarvam dashboard.
- **TTS pitch/loudness rejected on bulbul:v3** — pitch and loudness are bulbul:v2-only. Use `--model bulbul:v2` or drop those flags.
- **Chat returns content: null with only reasoning** — Set `--max-tokens` explicitly — hidden reasoning can consume the token budget before content.
- **Translate rejects >1000 chars** — mayura:v1 caps at 1000 chars. Use `--model sarvam-translate:v1` for up to 2000 chars.
- **Rate limit 429** — Sarvam uses token-bucket limits (translate 60/min, TTS 60/min, chat 40/min on sarvam-105b). Add pacing or retry with backoff.
