# The Rundown University — Printing Press CLI

## Prerequisites: Install the CLI

This skill drives the `rundown-pp-cli` binary. **You must verify the CLI is installed before invoking any command from this skill.** If it is missing, install it first:

1. Install via the Printing Press installer. It defaults binaries to `$HOME/.local/bin` on macOS/Linux and `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\PrintingPress\bin` on Windows:
   ```bash
   npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install rundown --cli-only
   ```
2. Verify: `rundown-pp-cli --version`
3. Ensure the reported install directory is on `$PATH` for the agent/runtime that will invoke this skill.

If the `npx` install fails (no Node, offline, etc.), fall back to a direct Go install (requires Go 1.26.6 or newer). This installs into `$GOPATH/bin` (default `$HOME/go/bin`), so add that directory to `$PATH` instead:

```bash
go install github.com/mvanhorn/printing-press-library/library/ai/rundown/cmd/rundown-pp-cli@latest
```

If `--version` reports "command not found" after install, the runtime cannot see the binary directory on `$PATH`. Do not proceed with skill commands until verification succeeds.

The Rundown's community feed has no date filter and no single-post endpoint, so questions like 'best rated this week' or 'read me that whole workflow' need a local mirror. This CLI syncs every workflow into SQLite, then answers them instantly with `top --since`, `use-cases`, `show`, `digest`, `tools rank` and `stack`. No account or API key is needed - every read endpoint is public.

## When to Use This CLI

Use this CLI whenever a question is about AI workflows the Rundown community has shared: whether a use case already exists, what the highest-rated recent posts are, which tools people actually build with, or what a specific workflow says end to end. It is the fast path for all of those - the whole corpus is mirrored locally, so answers come back without browsing the site.

## Anti-triggers

Do not use this CLI for:
- Do not use this CLI to upvote, bookmark, comment on, or publish posts - those need a signed-in session and are not implemented.
- Do not use it for The Rundown's newsletter archive or news articles; it only covers the community workflow hub.
- Do not use it as a general AI-tool directory - `tools` reflects only what this community has tagged.

## Unique Capabilities

These capabilities aren't available in any other tool for this API.

### Local state that compounds
- **`top`** — Rank the highest-upvoted workflows inside a time window like 7d or 30d.

  _This is the answer to 'bring me the best workflows this week' in one call instead of paging the feed and eyeballing dates._

  ```bash
  rundown-pp-cli top --since 7d --limit 5 --agent
  ```
- **`digest`** — Summarise a time window: how many workflows landed, the top posts, the most-used tools and the busiest authors.

  _Use this for a standing 'what happened in the community' check rather than scrolling the feed._

  ```bash
  rundown-pp-cli digest --since 7d --agent
  ```
- **`tools rank`** — Rank AI tools by how often they appear in workflows and by the upvotes those workflows earned.

  _Use this to see which tools the community actually builds with, as opposed to which ones merely exist in the dropdown._

  ```bash
  rundown-pp-cli tools rank --since 30d --limit 15
  ```
- **`stack`** — Show which other tools appear alongside a given tool, so you can see the stacks people really run.

  _Use this when picking complementary tooling, or to answer 'what do people pair with X'._

  ```bash
  rundown-pp-cli stack claude-code --limit 10
  ```

### Search that actually finds things
- **`use-cases`** — Answer 'are there any workflows for X' by blending the server's semantic search with local full-text search, then ranking by upvotes.

  _Reach for this whenever someone asks whether the community has already solved a problem, before designing a workflow from scratch._

  ```bash
  rundown-pp-cli use-cases "cold email outreach" --limit 5 --agent
  ```
- **`show`** — Print one workflow in full - body, tools, industries, author and comments - in a single call.

  _Use this after search to actually read a workflow instead of returning a truncated feed card._

  ```bash
  rundown-pp-cli show 89da5324-f822-4a4b-a30e-b33cfac60a95
  ```

## Command Reference

**comments** — Discussion threads attached to workflow posts

- `rundown-pp-cli comments <post_id>` — List comments on a workflow post

**leaderboard** — Weekly community contributor leaderboard

- `rundown-pp-cli leaderboard` — This week's top contributors by points (server always returns the weekly window)

**posts** — Community workflow posts

- `rundown-pp-cli posts` — List community workflow posts with server-side filters

**tools** — Catalogue of AI tools referenced by community workflows

- `rundown-pp-cli tools` — List every tool slug the community can tag a workflow with


## Freshness Contract

This printed CLI owns bounded freshness only for registered store-backed read command paths. In `--data-source auto` mode, those paths check `sync_state` and may run a bounded refresh before reading local data. `--data-source local` never refreshes. `--data-source live` reads the API and does not mutate the local store. Set `RUNDOWN_NO_AUTO_REFRESH=1` to skip the freshness hook without changing source selection.

Covered paths:

- `rundown-pp-cli leaderboard`
- `rundown-pp-cli leaderboard get`
- `rundown-pp-cli leaderboard list`
- `rundown-pp-cli leaderboard search`
- `rundown-pp-cli posts`
- `rundown-pp-cli posts get`
- `rundown-pp-cli posts list`
- `rundown-pp-cli posts search`
- `rundown-pp-cli tools`
- `rundown-pp-cli tools get`
- `rundown-pp-cli tools list`
- `rundown-pp-cli tools search`

When JSON output uses the generated provenance envelope, freshness metadata appears at `meta.freshness`. Treat it as current-cache freshness for the covered command path, not a guarantee of complete historical backfill or API-specific enrichment.

### Finding the right command

When you know what you want to do but not which command does it, ask the CLI directly:

```bash
rundown-pp-cli which "<capability in your own words>"
```

`which` resolves a natural-language capability query to the best matching command from this CLI's curated feature index. Exit code `0` means at least one match; exit code `2` means no confident match — fall back to `--help` or use a narrower query.

## Recipes

### Best workflows this week

```bash
rundown-pp-cli top --since 7d --limit 5
```

Windows the local mirror by createdAt and ranks by upvotes - the query the live API cannot express.

### Does a use case exist for this?

```bash
rundown-pp-cli use-cases "invoice reconciliation" --limit 5
```

Runs the server's semantic search and local FTS together, de-duplicates, and ranks what comes back by upvotes.

### Narrow to one tool and read the winners

```bash
rundown-pp-cli posts --tool claude-code --sort top --limit 5 --agent --select id,title,upvoteCount
```

Server-side tool filtering with a trimmed agent payload - only three fields come back instead of full post bodies.

### What do people pair with n8n?

```bash
rundown-pp-cli stack n8n --limit 10
```

Self-joins the mirrored post-to-tool mapping to surface the stacks that co-occur in real workflows.

### Read one workflow end to end

```bash
rundown-pp-cli show 89da5324-f822-4a4b-a30e-b33cfac60a95
```

Reassembles the post and its comment thread into a single readable document, body included in full.

## Auth Setup

No authentication required. Every read endpoint used by this CLI (`/posts`, `/posts/{id}/comments`, `/tools`, `/leaderboard`) is served publicly without a session. Upvoting, bookmarking, commenting and posting do require a signed-in Clerk session and are deliberately not implemented here.

Run `rundown-pp-cli doctor` to verify setup.

## Agent Mode

Add `--agent` to any command. Expands to: `--json --compact --no-input --no-color`.

- **Pipeable** — JSON on stdout, errors on stderr
- **Filterable** — `--select` keeps a subset of fields. Dotted paths descend into nested structures; arrays traverse element-wise. Critical for keeping context small on verbose APIs:

  ```bash
  rundown-pp-cli comments mock-value --agent --select id,postId,parentCommentId
  ```
- **Previewable** — `--dry-run` shows the request without sending
- **Offline-friendly** — sync/search commands can use the local SQLite store when available
- **Non-interactive** — never prompts, every input is a flag
- **Read-only** — do not use this CLI for create, update, delete, publish, comment, upvote, invite, order, send, or other mutating requests

### Response envelope

Commands that read from the local store or the API wrap output in a provenance envelope:

```json
{
  "meta": {"source": "live" | "local", "synced_at": "...", "reason": "..."},
  "results": <data>
}
```

Parse `.results` for data and `.meta.source` to know whether it's live or local. A human-readable `N results (live)` summary is printed to stderr only when stdout is a terminal AND no machine-format flag (`--json`, `--csv`, `--compact`, `--quiet`, `--plain`, `--select`) is set — piped/agent consumers and explicit-format runs get pure JSON on stdout.

## Paths and state

Agents should treat the CLI's path resolver as part of the runtime contract:

- Use `--home <dir>` for one invocation, or set `RUNDOWN_HOME=<dir>` to relocate all four path kinds under one root.
- Use per-kind env vars only when a specific kind must diverge: `RUNDOWN_CONFIG_DIR`, `RUNDOWN_DATA_DIR`, `RUNDOWN_STATE_DIR`, `RUNDOWN_CACHE_DIR`.
- Resolution order is per-kind env var, `--home`, `RUNDOWN_HOME`, XDG (`XDG_CONFIG_HOME`, `XDG_DATA_HOME`, `XDG_STATE_HOME`, `XDG_CACHE_HOME`), then platform defaults.
- `config` contains settings like `config.toml` and profiles. `data` contains `credentials.toml`, `data.db`, cookies, and auth sidecars. `state` contains persisted queries, jobs, and `teach.log`. `cache` contains regenerable HTTP/cache files.
- Stored secrets live in `credentials.toml` under the data dir. Existing legacy `config.toml` secrets are read for compatibility and leave `config.toml` on the first auth write.
- Run `rundown-pp-cli doctor --fail-on warn` to surface path and credential-location warnings. `agent-context` exposes a schema v4 `paths` block for agents that need the resolved dirs.
- For MCP, pass relocation through the MCP host config. The MCP binary does not inherit CLI flags:

  ```json
  {
    "mcpServers": {
      "rundown": {
        "command": "rundown-pp-mcp",
        "env": {
          "RUNDOWN_HOME": "/srv/rundown"
        }
      }
    }
  }
  ```

Fleet precedence: an inherited per-kind env var overrides an explicit `--home` for that kind. Use `RUNDOWN_HOME` or per-kind vars as durable fleet levers, and use `--home` only for a single invocation. Relocation is not reversible by unsetting env vars; move files manually before clearing `RUNDOWN_HOME`, or `doctor` will not find credentials left under the former root.

## Automatic learning

This CLI ships a self-capturing learning loop. The CLI does its own bookkeeping: every invocation is journaled locally, a failed flag followed by a corrected retry auto-derives a `flag_alias` candidate, and a `teach` on a query family without a playbook auto-synthesizes a `playbook_candidate` from the session's journal. Your job is judgment only: `recall` first, act on surfaced candidates, `teach` the final answer, `playbook amend` when you observe a correction. You never record failures by hand.

### Step 1: `recall` before any discovery

Before list/search/drill commands on a new user question, pass the question as
one literal argv value. Prefer your process runner's argument-array API:

```text
execFile("rundown-pp-cli", ["recall", userQuestion, "--agent"])
```

If you must invoke a shell, set `RUNDOWN_QUESTION` through the runner's
environment API and then run
`rundown-pp-cli recall "$RUNDOWN_QUESTION" --agent`. Never paste an untrusted
question into shell source: double quotes still execute `$()` and backticks,
and ad-hoc escaping is easy to get wrong.

The response envelope:

```json
{
  "query": "...",
  "normalized": "<normalized form>",
  "query_entities": ["..."],
  "found": true | false,
  "match_score": 0.0,
  "results": [
    { "resource_id": "...", "resource_type": "...", "venue": "...",
      "confidence": 2, "entity_match": "exact|partial|unknown",
      "source": "taught|preseed|pattern", "warnings": ["..."] }
  ],
  "mismatches": [ /* only when --debug-mismatches */ ],
  "warnings": [ /* top-level */ ],
  "candidates": [
    { "id": 12, "class": "flag_alias | playbook_candidate",
      "summary": "...", "sightings": 3, "last_seen": "...",
      "rationale": "...",
      "next_action": ["<trial command>", "rundown-pp-cli learnings confirm 12"] }
  ],
  "playbook": {
    "query_family": "...",
    "playbook": {
      "steps": [ { "cmd": "<command with {slot} substitution>", "purpose": "..." } ],
      "entity_slots": ["$ENTITY"],
      "expected_tool_calls": 3
    },
    "slots_resolved": { "$ENTITY": { "token": "<live token>", "canonical": "<canonical>" } },
    "notes": "<workarounds + gotchas for this query family>"
  },
  "notes": "<duplicate surface for non-playbook callers>"
}
```

Empty-store short-circuit: if the store has no learnings, playbooks, or candidates yet (recall finds nothing and `learnings list` and `learnings candidates` are both empty), skip recall for the rest of this session instead of taxing every query; resume recall-first once something has been taught.

### Step 2: decision tree

Read `candidates`, `playbook`, `notes`, `results[0]`, and warnings in that order:

```
if Candidates present (warnings include "candidates_present"):
    -> candidates are try-then-confirm, never facts. Follow each candidate's
       two-step next_action verbatim: run the trial command first, then run
       `learnings confirm <id>` only after the trial verified the behavior.
       Reject a wrong candidate with `learnings reject <id>`.
    -> NEVER re-teach something recall surfaced as a candidate; confirm or
       reject that candidate instead of teaching a duplicate.
    -> candidates ride alongside playbooks and resource hits, not instead of
       them; continue with the branches below after acting on them.

if Playbook present:
    -> READ Playbook.notes verbatim FIRST (workarounds + gotchas the CLI surface doesn't expose)
    -> replay Playbook.steps in order, substituting Playbook.slots_resolved entries
       for the entity slot tokens. If a step's slot is unresolved, fall back to
       discovery for that step only.
    -> the Playbook's expected_tool_calls is a budget; if you find yourself running
       materially more, record the divergence via `rundown-pp-cli playbook amend`
       at end-of-session.

elif Notes present (no Playbook):
    -> read Notes verbatim before any discovery step; they carry known gotchas
       for this query family even when no structured choreography exists yet.

elif Found AND Results[0].EntityMatch == "exact" AND Results[0].Confidence >= 2:
    -> skip discovery; fetch live data for Results[*].ResourceID in parallel

elif Found AND Results[0].EntityMatch == "partial":
    -> candidate hint, NOT a hit; read the resource title to validate before trusting

elif (any row in Mismatches[] when --debug-mismatches was passed):
    -> treat as cold start; the stored learning is for a different entity
       (different canonical resolved from query_entities)

else:  // Found == false, no playbook, no notes
    -> cold start; run discovery normally; teach the answer afterward (Step 4).
       If the family has no playbook yet, that teach auto-synthesizes a
       playbook candidate from this session's journal - you do not need to
       record one by hand.
```

Playbook and Notes are orthogonal to the per-resource path. A recall response can carry both a Playbook AND a `Results[]` hit - use both: the Playbook tells you which choreography to run; the resource hits short-circuit specific steps. Default to skipping `mismatches`; pass `--debug-mismatches` only when investigating cold-start surprises.

Candidate judgment details: `learnings confirm <id>` prints the candidate's full payload before materializing it - check that the printed payload matches the behavior you verified. `learnings reject <id>` tombstones the derivation signature so the same candidate does not resurface. The envelope carries only the few candidates worth acting on now; `rundown-pp-cli learnings candidates` lists the full open set.

Graceful degradation: if `learnings confirm` is an unknown command, you are driving an older binary - ignore the candidates guidance and follow the rest of the protocol.

### Step 3: always read `warnings`

- `low_confidence`: row exists at `confidence<2`. Treat as a hint, not a skip-discovery hit.
- `resource_not_in_store`: the local store doesn't have the resource the learning points at. The match validator couldn't classify entities — direct-fetch and re-evaluate.
- `cross_alias_match` (per-result): the row was taught under a different alias and matched the live query's canonical via `entity_lookups` (e.g., a "USA" teach satisfying a "United States" recall). Trust the resource_id.
- `similar_shape_different_entity:<canonical>` (top-level): a structurally matching row exists but its canonical entity differs from the live query's. Treated as cold start; the warning carries the conflicting canonical as a hint, but the row is NOT promoted into Results.
- `ambiguous_alias` (top-level): a single query entity resolved to multiple canonicals (e.g., "Cards" → Arizona Cardinals + St. Louis Cardinals). Surface the ambiguity from context before committing to a resource.
- `candidates_present` (top-level): the envelope carries a `candidates` section. Handle it via the candidates branch in Step 2 before anything else.
- `lookup_refresh_available` (top-level): an entity in the query has no lookup row yet, but synced data could provide one. Run `rundown-pp-cli sync` to refresh entity lookups.
- Top-level `no_learnings_for_query_family`: the table had no rows above the Jaccard floor. Pure cold start.

### Step 4: `teach &` after finalizing your response - always

Teaching is unconditional. After resolving a query the store could not answer, background-teach the final resource mapping - no call-count threshold, no judging whether it was "worth" learning. The teach is the anchor of the loop: it triggers playbook synthesis for a family without a playbook, and same-referent phrasings fold into one family so near-duplicate teaches do not fragment the store. Fire it after assembling your user-facing response but BEFORE emitting it. Prefer an asynchronous argument-array process runner. For a shell, set `RUNDOWN_TEACH_QUERY`, `RUNDOWN_RESOURCE_TYPE`, and `RUNDOWN_RESOURCE_ID` through the runner's environment API, then run:

```bash
rundown-pp-cli teach --query "$RUNDOWN_TEACH_QUERY" --resource-type "$RUNDOWN_RESOURCE_TYPE" --resource "$RUNDOWN_RESOURCE_ID" &
```

Silent on success. Errors only land in `teach.log` under the resolved state dir. Teach the **most specific** resource - if the user asked a broad question and you walked through parent records to find the specific answer, teach the leaf id, not the parent. The CLI uses seeded `entity_lookups` for cross-alias resolution at recall time, so a teach under one alias (e.g., "Niners") satisfies future queries under another alias (e.g., "49ers", "San Francisco") automatically.

PII rule: set `RUNDOWN_TEACH_QUERY` to the structural question with identifiers stripped - never include names, emails, phone numbers, account ids, or other personal identifiers in taught queries or notes. The CLI scans teach queries for obvious email/phone shapes and warns, but does not block; strip before teaching rather than relying on the warning. To teach several resources, append `--resource` arguments using the runner's argument-array API or separate environment values. Never paste the question or resource IDs into shell source.

### Step 5: playbooks - optional flags, automatic synthesis

You do not need to decide whether a session "deserves" a playbook: a teach on a family without one auto-synthesizes a `playbook_candidate` from the session's journal, and the next session judges it via confirm/reject. Attach explicit playbook flags only when you already hold choreography worth recording verbatim - workarounds the CLI didn't surface (silently-dropped flags, undocumented params, pagination tricks, payload gotchas). Prefer the **integrated one-call form** - record the resource learning and the playbook in the same `teach` invocation. Set the file paths through the runner's environment API too:

```bash
# Common case: record both the resource learning AND the playbook in one call.
rundown-pp-cli teach \
  --query "$RUNDOWN_TEACH_QUERY" \
  --resource "$RUNDOWN_RESOURCE_ID" \
  --playbook-file "$RUNDOWN_PLAYBOOK_FILE" \
  --playbook-notes-file "$RUNDOWN_NOTES_FILE" &

# Alternate: playbook-only (no resource to record alongside).
rundown-pp-cli teach-playbook \
  --query "$RUNDOWN_TEACH_QUERY" \
  --playbook-file "$RUNDOWN_PLAYBOOK_FILE" \
  --notes-file "$RUNDOWN_NOTES_FILE" &
```

Playbook files are JSON with `steps`, `entity_slots`, `expected_tool_calls`. Notes files are markdown carrying the gotchas verbatim. File-free callers (MCP-only agents) pass the same content inline: `--playbook-json` and `--playbook-notes` on the integrated `teach` form, `--playbook-json` and `--notes` on `teach-playbook`. On the integrated `teach` form, the playbook flags are optional - omit them entirely for a resource-only teach. On the standalone `teach-playbook` form, at least one of the playbook and notes flags must be set; both empty is rejected. Playbooks are keyed on the structural query family (entities stripped) so a recipe taught from one entity-shaped query applies to every other query of the same shape, with `slots_resolved` binding the live query's canonical at recall time.

When you DO find a playbook on a future recall, treat it as ground truth: replay the steps with `slots_resolved` substitutions, skip the discovery that the choreography already documents, and read `notes` before any step.

### Step 6: `playbook amend &` when your debug response identifies a correction

If your debug-protocol response identifies a concrete correction the notes or playbook should know — a workaround, an undocumented endpoint shape, a stale field name, observed schema drift, an empty-payload fallback — fire `playbook amend` BEFORE emitting your user-facing response. Same fire-and-forget posture as `teach`. Set `RUNDOWN_QUESTION` to the exact recall query and `RUNDOWN_CORRECTION` to the note through the runner's environment API:

```bash
rundown-pp-cli playbook amend \
  --query "$RUNDOWN_QUESTION" \
  --add-note "$RUNDOWN_CORRECTION" &
```

What counts as worth amending: a behavior you OBSERVED this session that future-you would benefit from knowing. Examples worth amending:

- A workaround for a CLI surface that silently drops or misorders a flag.
- An undocumented endpoint shape (response wrapped in `{meta, results}`, payload nested two levels deeper than the docs claim).
- Observed schema drift (a field renamed, an index that shifted between seasons, a category label that the API now returns lower-cased).

What does NOT belong in notes:

- The year-specific or entity-specific answer to the user's question. That's the response, not a learning.
- Per-team / per-athlete / per-row data the playbook already retrieves at runtime.
- Statements that paraphrase what the existing notes already say.

The amend command appends to the family's existing notes with a timestamped marker (`[amend YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MMZ]: <text>`). Multiple amends accumulate; the audit trail is visible. If no playbook exists yet for the family, amend creates a notes-only one (so cold-start corrections still land).

#### PII discipline for amend notes

`playbook amend` notes are designed to potentially flow upstream as shared knowledge in future versions of the Printing Press. Keep them clean of user-identifying content so the upstream-contribution path stays open without retroactive scrubbing:

- **Do NOT embed** paths to user filesystems, personal API keys or tokens, user email addresses, user GitHub handles, or specific query histories tied to a single user.
- **Acceptable**: endpoint shapes, undocumented field names, API gotchas, observed schema drift, workarounds for CLI surfaces, generalizable pagination or retry tactics.

If a correction is only meaningful with user-specific context, it belongs in a personal note, not in the playbook amend.

### Measuring the loop

`rundown-pp-cli learnings stats` reports recall hit rate, teach-to-reuse, playbook resolution rate, and candidate confirm/reject counts from the local `learn_events` table. Rates are null until they have a denominator; everything stays on this machine. Use it to check whether the loop is earning its keep for this CLI.

### Disabling learning

- `--no-learn` on a single command short-circuits both `recall` and the `teach` write path. Use for deterministic agent flows or tests that must not be affected by accumulated learnings.
- `RUNDOWN_NO_LEARN=true` in the environment globally disables the pipeline.

## Agent Feedback

When you (or the agent) notice something off about this CLI, record it:

```
rundown-pp-cli feedback "the --since flag is inclusive but docs say exclusive"
rundown-pp-cli feedback --stdin < notes.txt
rundown-pp-cli feedback list --json --limit 10
```

Entries are stored locally as `feedback.jsonl` under the resolved data dir. They are never POSTed unless `RUNDOWN_FEEDBACK_ENDPOINT` is set AND either `--send` is passed or `RUNDOWN_FEEDBACK_AUTO_SEND=true`. Default behavior is local-only.

Write what *surprised* you, not a bug report. Short, specific, one line: that is the part that compounds.

## Output Delivery

Every command accepts `--deliver <sink>`. The output goes to the named sink in addition to (or instead of) stdout, so agents can route command results without hand-piping. Three sinks are supported:

| Sink | Effect |
|------|--------|
| `stdout` | Default; write to stdout only |
| `file:<path>` | Atomically write output to `<path>` (tmp + rename) |
| `webhook:<url>` | POST the output body to the URL (`application/json` or `application/x-ndjson` when `--compact`) |

Unknown schemes are refused with a structured error naming the supported set. Webhook failures return non-zero and log the URL + HTTP status on stderr.

## Named Profiles

A profile is a saved set of flag values, reused across invocations. Use it when a scheduled or recurring agent reuses the same saved flags while providing different input each run.

```
rundown-pp-cli profile save briefing --json
rundown-pp-cli --profile briefing comments mock-value
rundown-pp-cli profile list --json
rundown-pp-cli profile show briefing
rundown-pp-cli profile delete briefing --yes
```

Explicit flags always win over profile values; profile values win over defaults. `agent-context` lists all available profiles under `available_profiles` so introspecting agents discover them at runtime.

## Exit Codes

| Code | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| 0 | Success |
| 2 | Usage error (wrong arguments) |
| 3 | Resource not found |
| 5 | API error (upstream issue) |
| 7 | Rate limited (wait and retry) |
| 10 | Config error |

## Argument Parsing

Parse `$ARGUMENTS`:

1. **Empty, `help`, or `--help`** → show `rundown-pp-cli --help` output
2. **Starts with `install`** → ends with `mcp` → MCP installation; otherwise → see Prerequisites above
3. **Anything else** → Direct Use (execute as CLI command with `--agent`)

## MCP Server Installation

1. Install the MCP server:
   ```bash
   go install github.com/mvanhorn/printing-press-library/library/ai/rundown/cmd/rundown-pp-mcp@latest
   ```
2. Register with Claude Code:
   ```bash
   claude mcp add rundown-pp-mcp -- rundown-pp-mcp
   ```
3. Verify: `claude mcp list`

## Direct Use

1. Check if installed: `which rundown-pp-cli`
   If not found, offer to install (see Prerequisites at the top of this skill).
2. Match the user query to the best command from the Unique Capabilities and Command Reference above.
3. Execute with the `--agent` flag:
   ```bash
   rundown-pp-cli <command> [subcommand] [args] --agent
   ```
4. If ambiguous, drill into subcommand help: `rundown-pp-cli <command> --help`.
