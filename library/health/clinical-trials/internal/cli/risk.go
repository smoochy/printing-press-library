// risk.go implements the `risk` command: an explainable, deterministic risk
// read on a single trial. It fetches one study by NCT id, then scores it across
// five observable signals — overall status / termination history, posted
// enrollment, geographic breadth, the lead sponsor's track record, and trial
// phase — and returns each factor's contribution so the score is auditable,
// never a black box.
