//	artificial intelligence 18 kept  -> 115 kept, 21 with a title hit

//
// Six pages is the point where correct results reliably appear ("SBIR Phase I:
// A Novel Gene Therapy Platform..." shows up only past page one) while the
// sequential fetch stays fast. Deliberately not a flag: the user should not
// have to know this workaround exists.
