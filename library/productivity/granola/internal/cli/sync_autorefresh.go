// PATCH(auto-refresh): new helper that lets the PersistentPreRunE hook call
// the public-API sync (sync-api) using sensible defaults, without going
// through Cobra's command dispatch or the worker-pool / output choreography
// in newSyncCmd's RunE.
//
// The user-facing `sync-api` command keeps all of its flags (--full, --since,
// --concurrency, --resources, --param, etc.) and its existing stdout/stderr
// shape. Auto-refresh deliberately bypasses that surface because:
//
//   1. The full ceremony (param parsing, worker pool, JSON event stream,
//      strict/critical exit-code policy) is not relevant to a per-command
//      refresh; the user already paid the cost of that choreography when
//      they ran `sync-api` themselves.
//   2. Auto-refresh must not write to stdout — pure JSON consumers should
//      see only the underlying command's output. The provenance line we do
//      emit goes to stderr from the autorefresh dispatcher (see U4).
//   3. Refactoring newSyncCmd's RunE in place would invite output-shape
//      drift the plan explicitly disallows.

// ApiSyncResult captures the headline numbers from a public-API sync.
// Per-resource success/warning/error counts mirror what newSyncCmd's
// exit-code policy uses, but auto-refresh treats anything that synced
// rows as "ok" — see runApiSync below.
type ApiSyncResult struct {
	// TotalRecords counts list-stage rows — the generic resources/notes
	// tables the generated sync writes.
	TotalRecords int
	// DomainRecords counts detail-stage rows: meetings, attendees,
	// transcript_segments, folders, folder_memberships. Kept separate from
	// TotalRecords so the two stages stay individually attributable.

	// was chained in, TotalRecords was the whole story and the provenance
	// line counted rows nothing reads.

	// notes.
	autoRefreshHydrateOverlap = 5 * time.Minute

	// autoRefreshHydrateCheckpoint is the sync_state key the detail stage
	// records its own high-water mark under. Deliberately NOT one of

// flags, no stdout output. Errors per resource are collected into the
// result struct; the function returns a non-nil error only when no
// resource synced any rows AND every resource failed (the "totally broken"
// case the user should see), mirroring the strictest branch of newSyncCmd's
// exit-code policy.
//
// PATCH(autorefresh-api-hydrates-domain-tables): this used to run the LIST
// stage only. syncResource writes the generic resources/notes tables, which
// no read command in this CLI queries — so auto-refresh reported
// "api=ok (N rows)" on stderr while `meetings`, `attendees`,
// `transcript_segments`, and `folder_memberships` (the store every read
// command serves from since the desktop cache became unreadable) went stale
// indefinitely. The detail stage that populates those tables now runs here
// too, exactly as newSyncApiCmd chains it, and a detail-stage failure is
