# Game GOAT

**Look up any game, find what to play next, and browse the Steam store from one CLI - RAWG search and ratings, remake-aware title resolution, and IsThereAnyDeal price history.**

## Install

The recommended path installs both the `game-goat-pp-cli` binary and the `pp-game-goat` agent skill (Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, Gemini CLI, GitHub Copilot, and other agents supported by the upstream [`skills`](https://github.com/vercel-labs/skills) CLI) in one shot:

```bash
npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install game-goat
```

For CLI only (no skill):

```bash
npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install game-goat --cli-only
```

For skill only — installs the skill into the same agents as the default command above, but skips the CLI binary (use this to update or reinstall just the skill):

```bash
npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install game-goat --skill-only
```

To constrain the skill install to one or more specific agents (repeatable — agent names match the [`skills`](https://github.com/vercel-labs/skills) CLI):

```bash
npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install game-goat --agent claude-code
npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install game-goat --agent claude-code --agent codex
```

### Without Node (Go fallback)

If `npx` isn't available (no Node, offline), install the CLI directly via Go (requires Go 1.26.6 or newer):

```bash
go install github.com/mvanhorn/printing-press-library/library/media-and-entertainment/game-goat/cmd/game-goat-pp-cli@latest
```

This installs the CLI only — no skill.

### Pre-built binary

Download a pre-built binary for your platform from the [latest release](https://github.com/mvanhorn/printing-press-library/releases/tag/game-goat-current). On macOS, clear the Gatekeeper quarantine: `xattr -d com.apple.quarantine <binary>`. On Unix, mark it executable: `chmod +x <binary>`.

## Install for Hermes

Install the CLI binary first. The installer writes binaries to a per-user managed bin directory by default: `$HOME/.local/bin` on macOS/Linux and `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\PrintingPress\bin` on Windows.

```bash
npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install game-goat --cli-only
```

Then install the focused Hermes skill.

From the Hermes CLI:

```bash
hermes skills install mvanhorn/printing-press-library/cli-skills/pp-game-goat --force
```

Inside a Hermes chat session:

```bash
/skills install mvanhorn/printing-press-library/cli-skills/pp-game-goat --force
```

Restart the Hermes session or gateway if the newly installed skill is not visible immediately.

## Install for OpenClaw
Install both the CLI binary and the focused OpenClaw skill. The installer defaults binaries to a per-user bin directory (`$HOME/.local/bin` on macOS/Linux, `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\PrintingPress\bin` on Windows):

```bash
npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install game-goat --agent openclaw
```

Restart the OpenClaw session or gateway if the newly installed skill is not visible immediately.

## Use with Claude Desktop

This CLI ships an [MCPB](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/mcpb) bundle — Claude Desktop's standard format for one-click MCP extension installs (no JSON config required).

To install:

1. Download the `.mcpb` for your platform from the [latest release](https://github.com/mvanhorn/printing-press-library/releases/tag/game-goat-current).
2. Double-click the `.mcpb` file. Claude Desktop opens and walks you through the install.
3. Fill in `RAWG_API_KEY` when Claude Desktop prompts you.

Requires Claude Desktop 1.0.0 or later. Pre-built bundles ship for macOS Apple Silicon (`darwin-arm64`) and Windows (`amd64`, `arm64`); for other platforms, use the manual config below.

<details>
<summary>Manual JSON config (advanced)</summary>

If you can't use the MCPB bundle (older Claude Desktop, unsupported platform), install the MCP binary and configure it manually.


```bash
go install github.com/mvanhorn/printing-press-library/library/media-and-entertainment/game-goat/cmd/game-goat-pp-mcp@latest
```

Add to your Claude Desktop config (`~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "game-goat": {
      "command": "game-goat-pp-mcp",
      "env": {
        "RAWG_API_KEY": "<your-key>"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

</details>

## Quick Start

```bash
game-goat-pp-cli auth set-token

# optional: store an IsThereAnyDeal key for prices/price-history
echo "$ITAD_API_KEY" | game-goat-pp-cli auth set-token --provider itad

game-goat-pp-cli games search "hollow knight" --json

game-goat-pp-cli ratings "hollow knight" --json

game-goat-pp-cli ratings 3498 --json

game-goat-pp-cli similar "hollow knight" --json

game-goat-pp-cli price-history "hollow knight" --json

game-goat-pp-cli prices "hollow knight" --country GB --json

```

## Unique Features

These capabilities aren't available in any other tool for this API.
- **`similar`** — Games like <title>: the seed's own studio first, then its defining gameplay tag (roguelite, metroidvania) found by tag-neighborhood co-occurrence, then a confidence-floored genre join. Every row carries its tier and a reason.
- **`retention`** — Community completion and drop verdict for one game from RAWG added_by_status counts (needs RAWG_API_KEY).
- **`price-history`** — Historical price tracking for one game: all-time / 1-year / 3-month lows, the current best storefront price, a dated change log, and a buy-now verdict, localised to a --country currency (needs ITAD_API_KEY).
- **`prices`** — Current prices across storefronts, cheapest first, with a --deals-only filter and the all-time low for context, localised to a --country currency (needs ITAD_API_KEY).
- **`steam search`** — Plural keyless search of the Steam store across games, demos, DLC, soundtracks, software, video, mods, and hardware, with store tags, price, release date, platforms, and demo links on every row.
- **`steam browse`** — Paginated Steam catalog browse filtered by app type, free-only, store tag, and coming-soon/released, localised with `--country`; "every free demo in my region" is one command.

## Recipes

### Games like one you loved

```bash
game-goat-pp-cli similar "Megabonk" --json --select results.name,results.tier,results.reason
```

### Play a franchise in order

```bash
game-goat-pp-cli series "zelda" --json
```

### Pin a remake when titles collide

```bash
game-goat-pp-cli ratings "resident evil 4" --year 2023 --json
```

A pinned `--year` is a hard constraint on the title too: if no game with that exact title was released in that year, the command reports not-found (drop `--year` or pass a RAWG id) rather than resolving a different game from the same year.

### Will people actually finish it?

```bash
game-goat-pp-cli retention "elden ring" --json
```

### Is now the cheapest it has ever been?

```bash
game-goat-pp-cli price-history "elden ring" --json
```

Historical lows (all-time, 1 year, 3 months), the current best storefront price, and a dated change log. Prices are localised to `--country` (ISO 3166-1 alpha-2; default `ITAD_COUNTRY` or US), so `--country GB` returns GBP. Requires an IsThereAnyDeal key — the `ITAD_API_KEY` env var or one stored via `auth set-token --provider itad`; get a free key at https://isthereanydeal.com/apps/.

### What does it cost where I live?

```bash
game-goat-pp-cli prices "elden ring" --country GB --deals-only --json
```

Current price at every storefront, cheapest first, plus the all-time low for context. `--deals-only` keeps just active discounts; `--limit` caps the rows.

### Search the Steam store

```bash
game-goat-pp-cli steam search "hollow knight" --json --select results.name,results.price,results.release_date
```

The keyless store search returns typed records: app type, release date, platforms, store tags, price, and the app's own demo links. `--type` takes a comma-separated list (game, demo, dlc, soundtrack, software, video, mod, hardware) and `--limit` goes up to 100. Text search has no second page — Valve's search service ignores an offset — so use `steam browse` when you need to page.

### Every free demo in my region

```bash
game-goat-pp-cli steam browse --type demo --free --country DE --page 2 --agent
```

Filtered catalog browse with real pagination: `--type`, `--free`, `--tag <name|tagid>` (repeat it or comma-separate; every tag is required), and `--coming-soon`/`--released`. `meta` carries `total`, `page`, `limit`, and `next_page`. Free-to-play and early access are attributes of a record rather than app types, so `--free` is how you ask for them.

## Steam data sources

The `steam` commands talk to Valve's store services directly and need no API key.

The documented developer API at https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/api is key-gated, and its only catalog enumerator — `IStoreService/GetAppList` — requires a Steam Web API key and cannot filter by demo, tag, or price. It also has no "list demos" endpoint. So this CLI uses the keyless store services the Steam store itself calls:

| Surface | Used for |
|---------|----------|
| `IStoreQueryService/SearchSuggestions` | text search across app types (up to 100 results) |
| `IStoreQueryService/Query` | filtered, paginated catalog enumeration |
| `IStoreBrowseService/GetItems` | full typed app records, including demo links |
| `IStoreService/GetTagList` | tag id to tag name |
| `store.steampowered.com/api/storesearch`, `/appdetails`, `/appreviews` | title to appid, current price, review scores |

Consequences worth knowing:

- **STEAM_API_KEY is not used.** The key-gated Web API (players, achievements, stats) is covered by the separate `steam-web` CLI.
- The four store services are not documented on the partner site, so their response shape could change; the client decodes them into typed records and pins the observed shapes in tests.
- Store results follow `--country` (default `STEAM_COUNTRY`, then `ITAD_COUNTRY`, then US) and `--lang`, so prices and availability come back localised like the IsThereAnyDeal path.
- Bundles cannot be enumerated: the store services expose no bundle filter, so `--type bundle` is rejected with that explanation instead of silently returning nothing.
- `ratings` reads the Steam appid from RAWG's own Steam store link for the game, which is exact, and only falls back to a store-aware title search. That is why rating a remake resolves instead of failing with `steam: no Steam app matched the title: "DOOM (2016)"`.
- Steam enrichment never fails a command: a Steam problem degrades the card and lists the source in `sources_missing`.

## Usage

Run `game-goat-pp-cli --help` for the full command reference and flag list.

## Paths & environment variables

This CLI separates local files into four path kinds:

| Kind | Contents |
|------|----------|
| `config` | User-editable settings such as `config.toml` and saved profiles |
| `data` | Durable local data: `credentials.toml`, `data.db`, cookies, browser-session proof files, and other auth sidecars |
| `state` | Runtime state such as persisted queries, jobs, and `teach.log` |
| `cache` | Regenerable HTTP/cache files |

Each kind resolves independently. The ladder is:

1. Per-kind env var: `GAME_GOAT_CONFIG_DIR`, `GAME_GOAT_DATA_DIR`, `GAME_GOAT_STATE_DIR`, or `GAME_GOAT_CACHE_DIR`
2. `--home <dir>` for this invocation
3. `GAME_GOAT_HOME` for a flat relocated root
4. XDG env vars: `XDG_CONFIG_HOME`, `XDG_DATA_HOME`, `XDG_STATE_HOME`, `XDG_CACHE_HOME`
5. Platform defaults matching existing installs

For containers and agent sandboxes, prefer a single relocated root:

```bash
export GAME_GOAT_HOME=/srv/game-goat
game-goat-pp-cli doctor
```

Under `GAME_GOAT_HOME=/srv/game-goat`, the four dirs resolve to `/srv/game-goat/config`, `/srv/game-goat/data`, `/srv/game-goat/state`, and `/srv/game-goat/cache`.

MCP servers do not receive CLI flags from the host. Put relocation in the host `env` block:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "game-goat": {
      "command": "game-goat-pp-mcp",
      "env": {
        "GAME_GOAT_HOME": "/srv/game-goat"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Precedence matters in fleets: an ambient per-kind variable such as `GAME_GOAT_DATA_DIR` overrides an explicit `--home` for that kind. Use `GAME_GOAT_HOME` or the per-kind variables for durable fleet relocation; treat `--home` as the weaker per-invocation lever.

Relocation is one-way. Unsetting `GAME_GOAT_HOME` does not move files back to platform defaults, and `doctor` cannot find credentials left under a former root. Move the files manually before unsetting relocation variables.

Existing installs keep working because the platform-default rung matches the legacy layout. On the first auth write, stored secrets leave `config.toml` and are consolidated into `credentials.toml` under the data directory. Run `game-goat-pp-cli doctor --fail-on warn` to check path and credential-location warnings in automation.

Steam store localisation uses `STEAM_COUNTRY` (falling back to `ITAD_COUNTRY`, then `US`) and `STEAM_LANG`. `STEAM_STORE_BASE_URL` and `STEAM_STORE_API_BASE_URL` override the two Steam hosts, which is useful for tests and mirrors.

### Self-learning loop

This CLI caches per-question discovery so repeat queries skip the walk and structurally similar queries get answered via entity substitution. The loop also self-captures: every invocation is journaled locally, and failed-flag corrections plus fresh teaches surface as candidates on the next `recall` for confirm/reject judgment. Agents call `recall` before discovery and fire `teach &` after answering. See the `## Automatic learning` section in `SKILL.md` for the full protocol.

- **`game-goat-pp-cli recall <query>`** - Look up cached resources for a query before running discovery
- **`game-goat-pp-cli teach`** - Record a query -> resource mapping (silent on success, safe to background with `&`)
- **`game-goat-pp-cli learnings list`** - Inspect taught rows
- **`game-goat-pp-cli learnings forget <query>`** - Undo a teach
- **`game-goat-pp-cli learnings candidates`** - List auto-captured candidates awaiting confirm/reject
- **`game-goat-pp-cli learnings stats`** - Local loop metrics: recall hit rate, teach-to-reuse, playbook resolution, candidate counts
- **`game-goat-pp-cli teach-pattern`** - Install a query/resource template up front
- **`game-goat-pp-cli teach-lookup`** - Add an entity mapping (e.g. country code, team alias) for pattern substitution

Pass `--no-learn` or set `GAME_GOAT_NO_LEARN=true` to disable the loop for deterministic flows.

The local store's schema version stamp is one-way: once this version of `game-goat-pp-cli` opens the database, older binaries refuse it with a version error — upgrade the binary rather than downgrading.

## Output Formats

```bash
# Human-readable table (default in terminal, JSON when piped)
game-goat-pp-cli creator-roles

# JSON for scripting and agents
game-goat-pp-cli creator-roles --json
# Filter to specific fields
game-goat-pp-cli creator-roles --json --select id,name,slug

# Dry run — show the request without sending
game-goat-pp-cli creator-roles --dry-run

# Agent mode — JSON + compact + no prompts in one flag
game-goat-pp-cli creator-roles --agent
```

## Agent Usage

This CLI is designed for AI agent consumption:

- **Non-interactive** - never prompts, every input is a flag
- **Pipeable** - `--json` output to stdout, errors to stderr
- **Filterable** - `--select <field>[,<field>...]` returns only fields you need
- **Previewable** - `--dry-run` shows the request without sending
- **Read-only by default** - this CLI does not create, update, delete, publish, send, or mutate remote resources
- **Offline-friendly** - sync/search commands can use the local SQLite store when available
- **Agent-safe by default** - no colors or formatting unless `--human-friendly` is set

Exit codes: `0` success, `2` usage error, `3` not found, `4` auth error, `5` API error, `6` local store miss, `7` rate limited, `10` config error.

## Health Check

```bash
game-goat-pp-cli doctor
```

Verifies configuration, credentials, and connectivity to the API.

## Configuration

Run `game-goat-pp-cli doctor` to see the resolved config, data, state, and cache directories. The platform-default config path is `~/.config/game-goat-pp-cli/config.toml`; `--home`, `GAME_GOAT_HOME`, and per-kind env vars can relocate it.

Static request headers can be configured under `headers`; per-command header overrides take precedence.

Environment variables:

| Name | Kind | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `RAWG_API_KEY` | per_call | Yes for live RAWG commands | Set to your API credential. Local search and analytics over synced data work without it. |

### agentcookie (optional)

If you use agentcookie to sync secrets across machines, this CLI auto-adopts agentcookie-managed credentials with no extra setup. When the daemon writes to this CLI's config, `game-goat-pp-cli doctor` reports `agentcookie: detected (managing credentials)` and `auth status` labels the credential source as `agentcookie`. Skip this section if you don't use agentcookie - the CLI works the same as any other.

## Troubleshooting
**Authentication errors (exit code 4)**
- Run `game-goat-pp-cli doctor` to check credentials
- Verify the environment variable is set: `echo $RAWG_API_KEY`
**Not found errors (exit code 3)**
- Check the resource ID is correct
- Run the `list` command to see available items
