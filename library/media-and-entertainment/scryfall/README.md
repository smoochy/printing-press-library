## Install

The recommended path installs both the `scryfall-pp-cli` binary and the `pp-scryfall` agent skill (Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, Gemini CLI, GitHub Copilot, and other agents supported by the upstream [`skills`](https://github.com/vercel-labs/skills) CLI) in one shot:

```bash
npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install scryfall
```

For CLI only (no skill):

```bash
npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install scryfall --cli-only
```

For skill only — installs the skill into the same agents as the default command above, but skips the CLI binary (use this to update or reinstall just the skill):

```bash
npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install scryfall --skill-only
```

To constrain the skill install to one or more specific agents (repeatable — agent names match the [`skills`](https://github.com/vercel-labs/skills) CLI):

```bash
npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install scryfall --agent claude-code
npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install scryfall --agent claude-code --agent codex
```

### Without Node (Go fallback)

If `npx` isn't available (no Node, offline), install the CLI directly via Go (requires Go 1.26.6 or newer):

```bash
go install github.com/mvanhorn/printing-press-library/library/media-and-entertainment/scryfall/cmd/scryfall-pp-cli@latest
```

This installs the CLI only — no skill.

### Pre-built binary

Download a pre-built binary for your platform from the [latest release](https://github.com/mvanhorn/printing-press-library/releases/tag/scryfall-current). On macOS, clear the Gatekeeper quarantine: `xattr -d com.apple.quarantine <binary>`. On Unix, mark it executable: `chmod +x <binary>`.

## Install for Hermes

Install the CLI binary first. The installer writes binaries to a per-user managed bin directory by default: `$HOME/.local/bin` on macOS/Linux and `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\PrintingPress\bin` on Windows.

```bash
npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install scryfall --cli-only
```

Then install the focused Hermes skill.

From the Hermes CLI:

```bash
hermes skills install mvanhorn/printing-press-library/cli-skills/pp-scryfall --force
```

Inside a Hermes chat session:

```bash
/skills install mvanhorn/printing-press-library/cli-skills/pp-scryfall --force
```

Restart the Hermes session or gateway if the newly installed skill is not visible immediately.

## Install for OpenClaw
Install both the CLI binary and the focused OpenClaw skill. The installer defaults binaries to a per-user bin directory (`$HOME/.local/bin` on macOS/Linux, `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\PrintingPress\bin` on Windows):

```bash
npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install scryfall --agent openclaw
```

Restart the OpenClaw session or gateway if the newly installed skill is not visible immediately.

## Use with Claude Desktop

This CLI ships an [MCPB](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/mcpb) bundle — Claude Desktop's standard format for one-click MCP extension installs (no JSON config required).

To install:

1. Download the `.mcpb` for your platform from the [latest release](https://github.com/mvanhorn/printing-press-library/releases/tag/scryfall-current).
2. Double-click the `.mcpb` file. Claude Desktop opens and walks you through the install.

Requires Claude Desktop 1.0.0 or later. Pre-built bundles ship for macOS Apple Silicon (`darwin-arm64`) and Windows (`amd64`, `arm64`); for other platforms, use the manual config below.

<summary>Manual JSON config (advanced)</summary>

If you can't use the MCPB bundle (older Claude Desktop, unsupported platform), install the MCP binary and configure it manually.


```bash
go install github.com/mvanhorn/printing-press-library/library/media-and-entertainment/scryfall/cmd/scryfall-pp-mcp@latest
```

Add to your Claude Desktop config (`~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "scryfall": {
      "command": "scryfall-pp-mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

</details>

## Quick Start

### 1. Install

See [Install](#install) above.

### 2. Verify Setup

```bash
scryfall-pp-cli doctor
```

This checks your configuration.

### 3. Try Your First Command

```bash
scryfall-pp-cli cards search --q example-value
```

## Usage

Run `scryfall-pp-cli --help` for the full command reference and flag list.

## Paths & environment variables

This CLI separates local files into four path kinds:

| Kind | Contents |
|------|----------|
| `config` | User-editable settings such as `config.toml` and saved profiles |
| `data` | Durable local data such as `data.db` |
| `state` | Runtime state such as persisted queries, jobs, and `teach.log` |
| `cache` | Regenerable HTTP/cache files |

Each kind resolves independently. The ladder is:

1. Per-kind env var: `SCRYFALL_CONFIG_DIR`, `SCRYFALL_DATA_DIR`, `SCRYFALL_STATE_DIR`, or `SCRYFALL_CACHE_DIR`
2. `--home <dir>` for this invocation
3. `SCRYFALL_HOME` for a flat relocated root
4. XDG env vars: `XDG_CONFIG_HOME`, `XDG_DATA_HOME`, `XDG_STATE_HOME`, `XDG_CACHE_HOME`
5. Platform defaults matching existing installs

For containers and agent sandboxes, prefer a single relocated root:

```bash
export SCRYFALL_HOME=/srv/scryfall
scryfall-pp-cli doctor
```

Under `SCRYFALL_HOME=/srv/scryfall`, the four dirs resolve to `/srv/scryfall/config`, `/srv/scryfall/data`, `/srv/scryfall/state`, and `/srv/scryfall/cache`.

MCP servers do not receive CLI flags from the host. Put relocation in the host `env` block:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "scryfall": {
      "command": "scryfall-pp-mcp",
      "env": {
        "SCRYFALL_HOME": "/srv/scryfall"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Precedence matters in fleets: an ambient per-kind variable such as `SCRYFALL_DATA_DIR` overrides an explicit `--home` for that kind. Use `SCRYFALL_HOME` or the per-kind variables for durable fleet relocation; treat `--home` as the weaker per-invocation lever.

Relocation is one-way. Unsetting `SCRYFALL_HOME` does not move files back to platform defaults, and `doctor` cannot find files left under a former root. Move the files manually before unsetting relocation variables.

Existing installs keep working because the platform-default rung matches the legacy layout. Run `scryfall-pp-cli doctor --fail-on warn` to check path warnings in automation.

### Self-learning loop

This CLI caches per-question discovery so repeat queries skip the walk and structurally similar queries get answered via entity substitution. The loop also self-captures: every invocation is journaled locally, and failed-flag corrections plus fresh teaches surface as candidates on the next `recall` for confirm/reject judgment. Agents call `recall` before discovery and fire `teach &` after answering. See the `## Automatic learning` section in `SKILL.md` for the full protocol.

- **`scryfall-pp-cli recall <query>`** - Look up cached resources for a query before running discovery
- **`scryfall-pp-cli teach`** - Record a query -> resource mapping (silent on success, safe to background with `&`)
- **`scryfall-pp-cli learnings list`** - Inspect taught rows
- **`scryfall-pp-cli learnings forget <query>`** - Undo a teach
- **`scryfall-pp-cli learnings candidates`** - List auto-captured candidates awaiting confirm/reject
- **`scryfall-pp-cli learnings stats`** - Local loop metrics: recall hit rate, teach-to-reuse, playbook resolution, candidate counts
- **`scryfall-pp-cli teach-pattern`** - Install a query/resource template up front
- **`scryfall-pp-cli teach-lookup`** - Add an entity mapping (e.g. country code, team alias) for pattern substitution

Pass `--no-learn` or set `SCRYFALL_NO_LEARN=true` to disable the loop for deterministic flows.

The local store's schema version stamp is one-way: once this version of `scryfall-pp-cli` opens the database, older binaries refuse it with a version error — upgrade the binary rather than downgrading.

## Output Formats

```bash
# Human-readable table (default in terminal, JSON when piped)
scryfall-pp-cli cards search --q example-value

# JSON for scripting and agents
scryfall-pp-cli cards search --q example-value --json

# Filter to specific fields
scryfall-pp-cli cards search --q example-value --json --select id,name,status

# Dry run — show the request without sending
scryfall-pp-cli cards search --q example-value --dry-run

# Agent mode — JSON + compact + no prompts in one flag
scryfall-pp-cli cards search --q example-value --agent
```

## Agent Usage

This CLI is designed for AI agent consumption:

- **Non-interactive** - never prompts, every input is a flag
- **Pipeable** - `--json` output to stdout, errors to stderr
- **Filterable** - `--select id,name` returns only fields you need
- **Previewable** - `--dry-run` shows the request without sending
- **Explicit retries** - add `--idempotent` to create retries when a no-op success is acceptable
- **Confirmable** - `--yes` for explicit confirmation of destructive actions
- **Piped input** - write commands can accept structured input when their help lists `--stdin`
- **Offline-friendly** - synced data supports local browsing and the CLI's local search command
- **Agent-safe by default** - no colors or formatting unless `--human-friendly` is set

Scryfall's `cards search`, `cards autocomplete`, and `cards get-random` need the live API. The local mirror cannot reproduce their results accurately, so they return an error when only local data is available. Exact card names, supported alternate card IDs, and set codes can resolve from synced data. Image/text formats and card face/version options also need the live API.

Exit codes: `0` success, `2` usage error, `3` not found, `5` API error, `7` rate limited, `10` config error.

## Health Check

```bash
scryfall-pp-cli doctor
```

Verifies configuration and connectivity to the API.

## Configuration

Run `scryfall-pp-cli doctor` to see the resolved config, data, state, and cache directories. The platform-default config path is `~/.config/scryfall-pp-cli/config.toml`; `--home`, `SCRYFALL_HOME`, and per-kind env vars can relocate it.

Static request headers can be configured under `headers`; per-command header overrides take precedence.

## Troubleshooting
**Not found errors (exit code 3)**
- Check the resource ID is correct
- Run the `list` command to see available items

## HTTP Transport

This CLI uses Chrome-compatible HTTP transport for browser-facing endpoints. It does not require a resident browser process for normal API calls.

TLS certificates are verified by default. For a trusted development or self-signed endpoint only, pass `--insecure` for one invocation, set `SCRYFALL_SKIP_TLS_VERIFY=true` for the current environment, or set `skip_tls_verify = true` in the config file for a persistent override.
