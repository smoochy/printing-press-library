// This file pins DetectRetraction at the engine level. The CLI-level gate
// (internal/cli/retraction_gate_test.go) covers filterRetracted with four
// cases; the marker forms, the withdrawn variant, the start anchor, and the
// index false positive below are only guarded here.
//
// Design under test, and why it has two tiers:
//
//	declared — the publisher's marker survives in the title. Measured on a
//	           50-work is_retracted:true sample and a 50-work title-search
//	           sample: every title-marked work was also flagged, 41/41, no
//	           false positive.
//	flagged  — only the index says so. Necessary because the worst case
//	           measured (a retracted meta-analysis on vitamin C) carries NO
//	           title marker. Kept separate because the flag demonstrably
//	           over-marks: the 2020 Lancet Commission dementia report is
//	           is_retracted:true although it only received a table
//	           correction, so the UI wording for this tier must not claim the
//	           publisher retracted anything.
//
// DetectRetraction takes the TITLE only, never title+abstract. The evidence
// is testdata/corpora_full/vaccines.json, which TestCorpusPapersAboutRetraction
// reads: two works there discuss the Wakefield retraction in their abstracts.
// Those are papers ABOUT a retraction, not retracted papers.

// retractionCase is one title with the index flag that accompanied it.
