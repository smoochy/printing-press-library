The occupancy overlay is fill-only: it adds population onto shelters already in the public feeds and never adds a site the Red Cross keeps off the public map, so the CLI shows only publicly listed shelters. It also fetches the Red Cross hidden set (hide_from_public other than 'No') and suppresses any matching shelter, even one FEMA's public feed lists. That hidden-set check is required even with --no-enrich or --data-source local; if it cannot be completed, the command fails before emitting shelter rows. FEMA is synchronized downstream of Red Cross, so a freshly opened shelter can appear in Red Cross first. The Red Cross EA endpoint requires a Referer header; Open_Shelters does not. The GIS layers are referenced, not ingested. Full NSS (beyond public OpenShelters) requires an MOU with FEMA.",
