# Disaster Shelter CLI (National Shelter System + American Red Cross, US only)

**Credible, real-time US (and territories) disaster shelter information for AI agents and people: which shelters are open right now, where they are (down to county and the incident that opened them), which take pets, which have a generator, and which are at capacity. Unions the FEMA National Shelter System OpenShelters feed with the American Red Cross open-shelter map feed (deduped) and best-effort enriches with FEMA's richer FEMA_NSS layer, honest about missing data.**

Gives agents and people the most comprehensive, credible open-shelter picture available: it unions FEMA's National Shelter System (NSS) OpenShelters feed with the American Red Cross Emergency-Action feed (the redcross.org map's source) and dedupes them, because FEMA is synchronized downstream of Red Cross and lags it by up to a day, so neither feed alone is complete. Coverage is the United States and its territories only (both FEMA NSS and the American Red Cross are US feeds), not other countries. FEMA rows are best-effort enriched with the richer FEMA_NSS layer (county/parish, the driving incident, the open date, generator and floodplain/surge attributes), and the CLI folds in live occupancy (current population, the general/medical/other/pet breakdown, capacity, and the driving incident) from the American Red Cross Open_Shelters layer, the one feed that reports a real headcount. Every shelter carries a source field recording which feeds it came from ('fema', 'redcross', or 'fema+redcross', with '+occupancy' appended once live population is merged in). It shows only publicly listed shelters: the Open_Shelters roster is used to fill population onto shelters already in the public feeds, never to add one, and any shelter the Red Cross keeps off its public map (hide_from_public) is dropped even when FEMA's feed lists it, so the tool stays conservative about never directing people to a site the Red Cross has not cleared for the public. It answers the questions people actually ask in a disaster, like 'the closest open shelter to me that allows pets' and 'which shelters are at capacity', filters by state, pets, accessibility, county, or generator, geocodes addresses (and bare ZIPs) when coordinates are missing, and never invents a number it does not have (a missed secondary fetch degrades to explicit null with a note, never a wrong value). Deep thanks to all first responders, emergency management practitioners, and relief nonprofit organizations for the work you do in communities when disaster strikes. This is an unofficial tool; in a life-threatening emergency call 911 and follow the official guidance and evacuation orders from FEMA, the American Red Cross, your local emergency management, and your local authorities.

## Install from source

This repository builds with the Go toolchain (1.26.4 or newer):

```bash
go install github.com/mvanhorn/printing-press-library/library/other/shelters/cmd/shelters-pp-cli@latest
```

Or clone and build the CLI plus the bundled MCP server:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mvanhorn/printing-press-library
cd shelters-pp-cli
make build       # binaries in ./bin
go test ./...    # parsers verified against real + clearly-labeled synthetic fixtures in internal/cli/testdata
```

Then run `shelters-pp-cli doctor` (no API key needed) and `shelters-pp-cli brief --markdown` for a one-call situational briefing.

## Install via the Printing Press library

Once this CLI is published to the public library, one command installs both the `shelters-pp-cli` binary and the `pp-shelters` agent skill (Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, Gemini CLI, GitHub Copilot, and other agents supported by the upstream [`skills`](https://github.com/vercel-labs/skills) CLI):

```bash
npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install shelters
```

For CLI only (no skill):

```bash
npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install shelters --cli-only
```

For skill only — installs the skill into the same agents as the default command above, but skips the CLI binary (use this to update or reinstall just the skill):

```bash
npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install shelters --skill-only
```

To constrain the skill install to one or more specific agents (repeatable — agent names match the [`skills`](https://github.com/vercel-labs/skills) CLI):

```bash
npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install shelters --agent claude-code
npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install shelters --agent claude-code --agent codex
```

### Pre-built binary

Download a pre-built binary for your platform from the [latest release](https://github.com/mvanhorn/printing-press-library/releases/tag/shelters-current). On macOS, clear the Gatekeeper quarantine: `xattr -d com.apple.quarantine <binary>`. On Unix, mark it executable: `chmod +x <binary>`.

<!-- pp-hermes-install-anchor -->
## Install for Hermes

Install the CLI binary first. The installer writes binaries to a per-user managed bin directory by default: `$HOME/.local/bin` on macOS/Linux and `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\PrintingPress\bin` on Windows.

```bash
npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install shelters --cli-only
```

Then install the focused Hermes skill.

From the Hermes CLI:

```bash
hermes skills install mvanhorn/printing-press-library/cli-skills/pp-shelters --force
```

Inside a Hermes chat session:

```bash
/skills install mvanhorn/printing-press-library/cli-skills/pp-shelters --force
```

Restart the Hermes session or gateway if the newly installed skill is not visible immediately.

## Install for OpenClaw
Install both the CLI binary and the focused OpenClaw skill. The installer defaults binaries to a per-user bin directory (`$HOME/.local/bin` on macOS/Linux, `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\PrintingPress\bin` on Windows):

```bash
npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install shelters --agent openclaw
```

Restart the OpenClaw session or gateway if the newly installed skill is not visible immediately.

## Use with Claude Desktop

This CLI ships an [MCPB](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/mcpb) bundle — Claude Desktop's standard format for one-click MCP extension installs (no JSON config required).

To install:

1. Download the `.mcpb` for your platform from the [latest release](https://github.com/mvanhorn/printing-press-library/releases/tag/shelters-current).
2. Double-click the `.mcpb` file. Claude Desktop opens and walks you through the install.

Requires Claude Desktop 1.0.0 or later. Pre-built bundles ship for macOS Apple Silicon (`darwin-arm64`) and Windows (`amd64`, `arm64`); for other platforms, use the manual config below.

<details>
<summary>Manual JSON config (advanced)</summary>

If you can't use the MCPB bundle (older Claude Desktop, unsupported platform), install the MCP binary and configure it manually.

```bash
go install github.com/mvanhorn/printing-press-library/library/other/shelters/cmd/shelters-pp-mcp@latest
```

Add to your Claude Desktop config (`~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "shelters": {
      "command": "shelters-pp-mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

## Quick Start

```bash
# Confirm the CLI is wired up; no API key needed.
shelters-pp-cli doctor

# What shelters are open right now (few or none when no disaster is active).
shelters-pp-cli shelters

# The closest open shelters to me that allow pets.
shelters-pp-cli near "2400 W Bradley Ave, Champaign, IL" --pets

# One-call situational briefing with the gratitude and safety footer.
shelters-pp-cli brief --markdown

```

## Unique Features

These capabilities aren't available in any other tool for this API.

### Closest shelter
- **`near`** — Ranks open shelters by straight-line distance from a lat,lon, ZIP, or street address; geocodes shelters that are missing coordinates and reports any it cannot locate rather than dropping them; filterable by pets, ADA, wheelchair, county/parish, and confirmed onsite generator.

  _Answers 'the closest shelter to me that allows pets' in one call; add --pets, --ada, or --wheelchair._

  ```bash
  shelters-pp-cli near 78566 --pets --limit 3
  ```

### Capacity
- **`capacity`** — Computes utilization only where both a population and a capacity are reported, labeling the denominator (evacuation vs post-impact), and surfaces shelters reported FULL without asserting it as ground truth.

  _Answers 'which shelter is at capacity?' honestly, marking unknowns as unknown._

  ```bash
  shelters-pp-cli capacity --state TX
  ```

### One-call situational awareness
- **`brief`** — One command returns the open count, breakdowns by state and by the driving incident, pet-friendly and accessible counts, and the capacity picture, with an optional human briefing.

  _Reach for this first when an agent asks 'what is the shelter situation right now'._

  ```bash
  shelters-pp-cli brief --markdown
  ```

### Listings and detail
- **`shelters`** — Open shelters from the union of FEMA OpenShelters and the American Red Cross feed (deduped, each tagged with a source field: fema, redcross, or fema+redcross), flattened and filterable by state, pets, ADA, wheelchair, managing org, status, county/parish, and confirmed onsite generator; FEMA rows best-effort enriched with the richer FEMA_NSS/0 layer (county, the driving incident, generator and floodplain/surge attributes).

  _Use to narrow open shelters to the ones that match a person's needs._

  ```bash
  shelters-pp-cli shelters --state FL --ada --json
  ```
- **`shelter`** — Full detail for one shelter joined on the stable shelter_id rather than the churning objectid, with unreported fields as explicit null; enriched with FEMA_NSS/0 fields (county, the driving incident, open date, generator, floodplain/surge, and the population breakdown) when reported.

  _Use when you have a shelter_id and need its full record._

  ```bash
  shelters-pp-cli shelter 368133
  ```

```

## Agent Usage

This CLI is designed for AI agent consumption:

- **Non-interactive** - never prompts, every input is a flag
- **Pipeable** - `--json` output to stdout, errors to stderr
- **Filterable** - `--select` returns only the fields you need
- **Honest** - missing data is null or "unknown", never invented
- **Read-only** - this CLI does not create, update, delete, publish, send, or mutate remote resources
- **Agent-safe by default** - no colors or formatting unless `--human-friendly` is set

Every response carries `source` and a client-side `fetched_at` (UTC), because the feed has no server timestamp.

Exit codes: `0` success, `2` usage error, `3` not found, `5` API error, `7` rate limited, `10` config error.

## Data, freshness, and honesty

- **Two feeds, unioned:** the FEMA National Shelter System OpenShelters feed (`gis.fema.gov`) is the spine; the CLI also fetches the American Red Cross Emergency-Action feed (`services.arcgis.com`, the `redcross.org` map's source) and **unions** the two, deduped on normalized name + state + ZIP. FEMA is synchronized downstream of Red Cross (every morning, then every 20 minutes), so a freshly opened shelter can appear in Red Cross up to a day before FEMA. Neither feed alone is complete; the union is. Every shelter carries a `source` field recording which feeds it came from (`fema`, `redcross`, or `fema+redcross`), with `+occupancy` appended once live occupancy is merged in. Both feeds cover the United States and its territories only, not other countries.
- **Live occupancy (current population), public shelters only:** the OpenShelters spine and the Red Cross map feed both carry a null population on their public mirrors, so the CLI also folds in the American Red Cross **Open_Shelters** operational layer (`services.arcgis.com`), the one feed that reports the current `total_population`, the general/medical/other/pet breakdown, the evacuation/post-impact capacity, and the driving incident. It is matched onto the union by name + state + ZIP (its id is an ArcGIS-internal id, not FEMA's `shelter_id`) as a **fill-only overlay**: it adds the headcount onto FEMA and Red Cross rows alike but **never introduces a shelter**. Open_Shelters is the Red Cross operational roster and includes sites the Red Cross deliberately keeps off the public map (privacy, transitional, non-walk-in), and it carries no public/hide flag of its own; a row with no match in either public feed is therefore withheld, so the CLI surfaces only publicly listed shelters. Capacity is often blank in blue-sky periods; population then has no denominator, which is why `capacity` honestly reports utilization as unknown.
- **Red Cross hidden shelters are suppressed:** the Red Cross marks some open shelters off its public map (`hide_from_public` other than `No`: privacy, transitional, or sites not cleared for walk-ins). The CLI fetches the complete hidden set and **drops any matching shelter, even one FEMA's public feed lists**. It matches on normalized name + state with compatible ZIP, or on normalized street address + exact ZIP5 when both records provide them. The Red Cross's own decision to keep a site off the public map wins over another feed listing it. If the hidden set cannot be verified, the command fails before emitting shelter rows.
- **Red Cross access:** the Red Cross Emergency-Action endpoint requires a `Referer: https://www.redcross.org/` header and returns Web Mercator geometry (the CLI requests `outSR=4326` for lat/lon); the Open_Shelters occupancy layer needs no Referer. No API key for either.
- **Enrichment:** FEMA rows are best-effort enriched with the richer FEMA_NSS/FeatureServer/0 layer joined by `shelter_id` (county, incident, generator, populations).
- **Best-effort honesty:** the Red Cross union, FEMA_NSS enrichment, and live occupancy merge are optional overlays on the authoritative FEMA spine. If any optional feed is skipped (`--no-enrich`, offline) or fails, the command degrades gracefully with an explanatory note. The Red Cross hidden-shelter filter is a required safety check in every data-source mode and fails closed. No personal contact columns (organizer name/phone/email, mailing address) are ever requested.
- **Freshness:** both feeds update roughly a few times a day and only change when an emergency manager or Red Cross updates a record, so status can lag reality. The feeds carry no per-record timestamp; this CLI stamps each response with the client fetch time.
- **Empty is normal:** a near-empty list means no disaster is active, not a failure. Counts spike during named events.
- **Coordinates:** frequently null even for open shelters; `near` geocodes from the street address and reports anything it cannot locate.
- **Capacity:** computed only where population and a capacity both exist; the denominator is labeled. Never assumed.
- **Full NSS** (beyond the public OpenShelters feed) requires an MOU with FEMA and is out of scope; `gis-links` points to it.

## Health Check

```bash
shelters-pp-cli doctor
```

Verifies configuration and connectivity to the feed.

## Configuration

Config file: `~/.config/shelters-pp-cli/config.toml`

Static request headers can be configured under `headers`; per-command header overrides take precedence.

## Troubleshooting

- **`shelters` is empty** — That is the normal quiet-state contract (no disaster active). It is not an error.
- **`near` says a shelter could not be located** — The feed omitted coordinates and the address would not geocode; those shelters are reported in a count and excluded from the ranking. Pass a precise `lat,lon` origin for the most accurate distances.
- **`capacity` shows "unknown" for a shelter** — The feed did not report both a population and a capacity for it; this tool will not invent a denominator.

### API-specific
- **shelters is empty** — That is the normal quiet-state contract (no disaster active). It is not an error.
- **near says a shelter could not be located** — The feed omitted coordinates and the address would not geocode; those shelters are reported in a count and excluded from the ranking. Pass a precise lat,lon origin for the most accurate distances.
- **capacity shows unknown for a shelter** — The feed did not report both a population and a capacity for it; this tool will not invent a denominator.
- **a shelter you expect is missing, or the red_cross note says the feed was unavailable** — Results union FEMA OpenShelters with the American Red Cross feed; if the Red Cross fetch fails the command degrades to FEMA-only with a note in the red_cross field. FEMA syncs downstream of Red Cross and can lag by up to a day, so a brand-new shelter may appear only under source 'redcross'. Retry, or check 'gis-links' for the source layers.
